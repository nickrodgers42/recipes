Cut or pull the chicken into small pieces. When rolling the crepes with filling inside, be sure to roll it twice and lay fold side down in pan).

> These crepes can be made hours before use and set aside until you are ready for them.
> They may even be frozen. Allow time for thawing and slow reheating.
