a:

> In 1975, Fred became interested in a Continuing Education Class offered at U.S.A.C., and enrolled in a food preservation and preparation class during the winter quarter, taught by Dr. V.Y. Mendenhall. This turned out to be one of the highlights of his life.
> Training was given on various methods and principles of preservation: freezing, unning, drying and curing of meats, vegetables and fruits. This included the making of beef jerky, corned beef. pork sausage, curing of hams and bacon, and even pickling eggs.
> He enjoyed it all.
