# Seasoned Rice
a:
* 1 C quick rice
* 1 can chicken consomme
* 1 can mushroom, un-drained
* 1 can cream of mushroom soup
* 1 pkg slivered almonds (don't add if almonds are cooked with chicken)

> Dice 2 medium onions and 1 small green pepper. Cook in 1 T butter until tender. Add ingredients
> Mix and put in buttered casserole with lid on. Bake 1% hours, stirring once during baking, at 375 degrees. Serves 10. Good cooked in electric fry pan.
> * Any quick rice may be used. If regular rice is used it needs to be cooked longer and may take more liquid, but works very well. Cook until liquid is absorbed.
