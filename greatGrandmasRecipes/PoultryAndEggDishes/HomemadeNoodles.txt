# Homemade Noodles
a:

> Add 1 t salt to one unbeaten egg. Gradually stir in flour with a fork until too stiff to mix.
> Then continue to knead, adding flour until it is no longer sticky, and very stiff. On a well floured board, roll out as thin as possible, adding flour as needed. Form into a roll starting from the longest side. With a sharp knife slice off in alternating diagonal thin slices. Break up, and add more flour to keep noodles from sticking together. (Some recipes add a little milk to' the egg, before adding flour.)These may be added as they are made to boiling soup, or may be dried thoroughly, and stored in plastic bags or tight containers.
> This is one of the few recipes I learned from my mother, as I watched her, fascinated, as she deftly diagonally sliced the dough to make the noodles short. Her chicken soup with noodles was a great favorite with our family.
