* 1 C flow
* 1 beaten egg
* 1 1/2 C water
* 1/2 C cornstarch
* 1 t baking powder
* dash salt
* 1/4 t Accent(MSG)
* at least 1 inch oil in frying pan

> Mix in order and stir lightly. Almost any type of seafood can be dipped in this batter deep and fried in 375 degree oil. Vegetables may also be cooked in this manner. Cut crosswise: eggplant, carrots, green beans, mushrooms, water cress, green onions, dry onions, sweet potatoes, asparagus, bell peppers, and zucchini. Fry until lightly browned.
> Try to cut into the same size pieces so they will cook evenly.
