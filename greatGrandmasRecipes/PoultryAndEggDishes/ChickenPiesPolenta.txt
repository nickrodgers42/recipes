# Chicken Pies Polenta
a:
* 2 1/2 C chopped onion
* 10 oz frozen peas, partially thawed
* 2 T vegetable oil
* 16 oz tomato sauce
* 1/2 t salt
* 3 C cubed, cooked chicken
* 1 t chili powder
* 1/4 C mayonnaise
* 1 (15 oz) box cornbread mix
* 2 T chopped chives

> Saute onion in oil in skillet. Add chicken, peas, tomato sauce, olives, chili powder and salt; combine thoroughly. Put into 6 10 02 individual casseroles or 1 2 quart baking dish.
> Prepare cornbread batter as directed. Fold in mayonnaise and chopped chives. Top each casserole with cornbread batter. Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes or until topping is golden brown. (I have never used this cornbread mix, but is very good with my cornmeal muffin batter or spoon bread for topping.)
