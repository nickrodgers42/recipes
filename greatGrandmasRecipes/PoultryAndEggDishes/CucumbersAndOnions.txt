# Cucumbers And Onions
a:

> Peel and slice about 2 C cucumbers and 1 C red or white onions. Mix together and sprinkle with a little salt. In a measuring cup put 1/3 C sugar, fill to A with white vinegar, and to 3/4 full with water. Pour over cucumbers and onions. Let stand a few minutes before serving.
> This has been a Baugh family favorite long before I came into the family.
