# Bran Parmesan Chicken
a:
* 1 1/2 C wheat bran flakes cereal (I used Wheaties) crushed to make about 3/4 C
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1/4 C milk
* 1/8 t salt
* 1/8 t sage
* 1 T butter
* 1/4 C flour
* 3 T grated Parmesan cheese
* 5 chicken pieces, washed and patted dry
* pepper

> In shallow pan or dish mix egg and milk; add flour, seasonings and cheese, stirring until smooth. Dip chicken pieces in egg mixture, coat with cereal and place in single layer, skin side up in greased or foil-lined pan. Drizzle with butter. Bake in oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. Uncover last 15 minutes. 2 to 3 servings. Pre-boiling chicken cuts down baking time. Double batter covers 14 pieces very well.
