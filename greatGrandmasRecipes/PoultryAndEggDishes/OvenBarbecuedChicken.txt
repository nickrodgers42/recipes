# Oven Barbecued Chicken
a:
* 1/2 C tomato juice
* 1/2 C cider vinegar
* 1/4 t Tabasco sauce
* 2 T brown sugar
* 2 t salt
* 1 to 2 cloves garlic
* 2 onions, sliced
* 1 C chili sauce

* 1/4 C butter
* 1/4 t dry mustard
* 1/4 t black pepper
* 2 cut up fryers

> Combine all but chicken and onions in saucepan. Simmer 30 minutes. The sauce improves with standing, so make it the day before. Put chicken, out side up in a single layer in roasting pan. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Put onion slices around and on top of chicken. Pour in enough water to cover bottom of pan. Brush with barbecue sauce. Bake uncovered at 350 for 15 minutes. Turn pieces, add barbecue sauce and bake another 15 minutes. Pour off part of liquid, leaving at least 1/2 C in bottom of pan.
> Turn chicken again so skin side is up. Pour or brush on barbecue sauce. Bake 1/2 to 1 hour longer at 350 degrees, basting frequently with the sauce in pan. Serves 6.
