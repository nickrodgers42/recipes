# Pickled Eggs
a:Richard Baugh

> Adding hard cooked eggs to the heated juice of canned, pickled beets, or the vinegar from dill or sweet pickles, produces a good cure and delicious pickled eggs. Let stand in closed container in refrigerator for a few days to absorb flavors. Will keep a long time refrigerated.
