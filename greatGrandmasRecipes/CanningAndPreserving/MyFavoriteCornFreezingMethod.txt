# My Favorite Corn Freezing Method
a:

> Put about 6 to 8 cleaned ears of corn into a large amount of boiling water.
> Blanch 3 minutes after water resumes boiling. Take ears out of hot water and put into very cold running water. Cool as quickly as possible.
> With sharp knife out about 1/2 way through kernels, scraping remaining corn from cob.
> This gets the corn without the rough kernel. Put into desired size bags pressing air out.
> Twist tops and put wire tie on bags about 1/2 inch above corn, to allow head space for freezing. Freeze as quickly as possible. Repeat procedure.
> To cook: Empty bag into a small amount of salted boiling water, cooking it as fast as possible without burning. Stir often. Add cream or butter and sugar if desired.
