# Brine Cure
a:
* For 100 pounds of meat:
* 6 gallons water
* 12 lbs salt
* 3 lbs sugar
* 3 oz saltpeter

> Dissolve the curing mixture in water and bring to a boil. This should be done on the day the hog is killed. Allow brine to get thoroughly cold. Never put warm brine on the meat.
> Pack the meat in a clean oak barrel or stone crock. (We used to use the barrel until we found a crock large enough. Both were equally good, but the crock is easier to use).
> Rub a little salt on each piece as it is packed down. Let the meat stand 24 hours and then remove it and pour out the accumulated liquid. re—pack the meat, putting the hams in first, then the shoulder, then the bacon last. Pack all the pieces with the skin side down, except the last piece, which should be packed with the skin side up. Weigh the meat down so that it will not float, using a hard flinty rock for this purpose or a jar filled with water. Now pour the brine you made yesterday over the meat. Be sure all meat is covered. Keep the barrel in a cool, well ventilated place. After 7 days the meat should be re—packed to insure a uniform cure. If ropiness of the brine is noticed at any time, remove the meat, wash it, scald the barrel with BOILING water, boil and skim the brine, cool, and re—pack the meat.
> The bacon should remain in the cure 1 1/2 days per pound, and the hams and shoulders, 3 days per pound.
