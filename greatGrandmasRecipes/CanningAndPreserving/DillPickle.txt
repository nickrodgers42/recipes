# Dill Pickle
a:Ardella Baugh

> 1 cellophane bag of dill weed is enough for 4-6 quart bottles of pickles. Put 2 T sugar in each quart bottle. Add some garlic and dill as cucumbers are put in. Boil together: 5 C water, 3 C vinegar, 6 T salt (not iodized). Put 2 garlic buds, sliced in each quart bottle.
> Pour boiling liquid over cucumbers in bottles. Green coloring added to boiling liquid gives good color to cured pickles. Seal jars while hot. For sure sealing, place jars in cold pack canner and boil for 10 minutes. Store in cool dark place. Pickles are ready to use in about 3 weeks.
