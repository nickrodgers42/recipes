# Pork And Beans
a:
* 50 lbs Great Northern beans, cleaned, and soaked 12 to 18 hours in lukewarm water.
* 25 lbs ham, un-boned
* 12 1/2 C brown sugar
* 1 1/4 C dry mustard
* 12 1/2 C catsup
* 1 3/4 C salt (approximate)
* 6 onions, chopped (if desired)

> Cook ham with above ingredients, except salt, until done. Add salt to taste. Remove ham from bone and dice. Mix with beans and put in cans. Prosess and seal.
> We did our canning at the Regional storehouse; ham, beans and seasonings were mixed together put in prepared cans and processed according to regulations. If canning at home, it would be necessary to consult the County Extension Office for the most upÂ« to-date pressure canning procedures. It is not difficult after ingredients are prepared.
