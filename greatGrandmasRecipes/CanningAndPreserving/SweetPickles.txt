> Wash 25 dill size cucumbers, or about the same bulk of small ones. Put in brine using about 1 1/2 C salt to 1 gallon water. Be sure salt is dissolved, and all cucumbers are covered with brine. Let stand 2 weeks. Take out of the brine, remove stems and cut large cucumbers in pieces. Put in crock and cover with cold water in which alum the size of a walnut is dissolved. Let stand over-night. Drain and wash off. Bring to a good boil in clear water and drain. Boil together 1 quart vinegar, 2 quarts sugar, 2 sticks cinnamon and 1 T whole cloves and pour over cucumbers. Drain and re-heat liquid and pour over cucumbers every morning for 3 mornings. The 4th morning, put cucumbers in jars. Fill jars with boiling liquid and make sure some of the spices are in each jar.
> Process in hot water bath for 10 minutes. Cool and store in cool, dark area.
