# Pickled Onions
a:Virginia Tims

> Put pickling onions into boiling water for a few minutes to make peeling easier. Put peeled onions into crock or enameled pan and add 1/2 C salt to each quart of water it takes to cover them. Mix with hands until all salt is dissolved. In the morning drain and rinse. Add enough water to cover onions and cook for 10 minutes uncovered. Put into hot sterilized 1/2 pint jars and add a boiling hot liquid made of 1 C sugar, 2 C vinegar, and 1 C water. Seal immediately.
