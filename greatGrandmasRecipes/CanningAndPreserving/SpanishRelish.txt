# Spanish Relish
a:Mother Baugh
* 3 quarts green tomatoes
* 2 quarts cucumbers
* 1 quart onions
* 2 quarts vinegar or enough to cover
* 4 C sugar
* 1/3 C salt.
* 1 t tumeric
* 1 t pepper
* 1/2 t cinnamon
* 1/4 t allspice
* 1/2 t cloves
* 3 T mustard.

> Coarse-grind the tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions before measuring. Add the vinegar, sugar, and salt.
> Cook for 2 to 3 hours, then add the rest of the ingredients.
> Stir as it thickens and cook a few minutes. Bottle while hot. Makes about 15 pints.
> Fred's father used to grind the vegetables for this relish in the evening after dinner, counting the number of measures needed as he emptied the little pan into a large crock to settle over night. In the morning Mother Baugh would dip off some of the excess liquid, so the cooking time would be less, as the liquid had to boil away.
> I borrowed the little pan she measured with and found it held about 1 quart, then with Mother Baugh's guesses she came up with the recipe for chili sauce.
