# Doughnuts
a:
* 4 C sifted flour
* 1/2 t nutmeg
* 1/4 t cinnamon
* 1 t salt
* 3/4 t soda
* 1/2 t cream of tartar
* 1 C thick sour milk or buttermilk
* 2 T shonening
* 3/4 C sugar
* 4 egg yolks or 2 eggs and 1 yolk

> Sift dry ingredients. Cream shortening and sugar. Add egg yolks and beat till light and fluffy. Add milk and dry ingredients. Mix until smooth. With as little handling as possible, roll dough on floured board to A inch thickness. Let dough stand 20 minutes. Cut with floured cutter. F ry in deep fat or oil 375 degrees, until brown, turning when first crack appears. Drain on absorbent paper. Makes 3 dozen. (If sweet milk is used instead of sour milk, reduce milk to 3/4 C, omit soda and cream of tartar, and use 3 1/2 t baking powder. Egg yolks make more tender dougnuts than whole eggs.)
> For orange doughnuts substitute juice of 2 oranges and 3% t grated orange rind for the milk. When cooled roll in 1/2 C sugar and 2 t grated orange rind.
