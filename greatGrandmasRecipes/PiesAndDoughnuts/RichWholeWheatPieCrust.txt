# Rich Whole Wheat Pie Crust
a:
* 1 1/2 C whole wheat flour
* 1 t baking powder
* 1/4 t salt
* 1/2 C sugar
* 4 T thick cream
* 1/2 stick soft butter
* 1 beaten egg

> Mix well and form into balls. Chill before rolling out. Bake as above.
> RULES FOR FLAKY CRUST:
> 1. Fat must be chilled. Natural lard makes the flakiest crust. Chilled butter, vegetable shortening or margarine may be used satisfactorily.
> 2. Cut fat into flour only until pieces are the size of large peas; smaller for mealy crust.
> 3. Bake at 425 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes. Chill or freeze crust before baking to obtain still better results.
> SPECIAL TOPPING FOR 2 CRUST PIES
> Bake extra single crust; cmmble fine and add 1/3 as much brown sugar as crust. Spread evenly on top of pie to take the place of the usual top crust. (Very good).
