* 1/3 C coconut bar cookie crumbs
* 15 to 16 coconut bar cookies
* 2 T melted butter
* 1/2 C broken pecans
* 3 pints vanilla ice cream
* 1/2 C drained crushed pineapple
* 1/2 C caramel or butterscotch ice cream topping

> Combine cookie crumbs and butter. Press mixture evenly over bottom of 9 inch buttered pie pan. Stand whole cookies up around the edge. (Cookies may have to be trimmed if too long). Chill.
> Combine pecans and ice cream topping. Chill. Spoon 1 pint ice cream into cookie shell.
> Top with 1/2 ice cream sauce, then 1/2 C crushed pineapple. Add additional 1 pint ice cream, then remaining sauce and pineapple. Top with remaining ice cream. Freeze until serving time. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
> BAKED ALASKA PIE: Cover hard ice cream filling, with meringue as made for top of any pie, making sure to seal meringue to crust all around. This can be kept in freezer until time to serve. Then remove from freezer, place on wooden board and bake 4 to 5 minutes in 500 degree oven, or until meringue is lightly browned. Serve immediately.
