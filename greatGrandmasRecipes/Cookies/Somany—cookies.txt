> (Sour milk can be made using 1 T vinegar in 1 C evaporated milk, stir and let stand a few minutes). Sift dry ingredients. Cream lard and sugar; add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Add flour alternately with the milk in which the 1/2 t soda has been dissolved. Add fruit, nut mixture blending well. Drop by spoons full on well greased baking sheet; or chill dough and roll dough in small balls. This makes better looking cookies. Bake at 350 degrees about 8 minutes. (Only 3 eggs may be used if 6% C flour are used instead of 5 C). Makes many cookies and freezes well.
