> Line a 15 x 10 inch jelly roll pan with foil. (I use a regular cookie sheet with sides).
> Melt in the pan, 1/4 C butter or margarine. (Set pan in oven long enough to melt).
> Sprinkle over the butter. 1 C chopped pecans, 1 1/3 C flaked coconut 1 15 oz can sweetened condensed milk. (Spread over all).
> In a mixing bowl, beat at high speed 2 minutes or until fluffy, 3 eggs (room temp)
> Gradually add 1 0 sugar and continue beating 2 more minutes.
> Sift together and add 3/4 C un-sifted flour 1/3 C cocoa 1/4 salt, 1/4 t soda; Add 1/3  C water and 1 t vanilla and beat at low speed for 1 minute.
> Pour evenly over pan and bake at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle small towel with powdered sugar; cover cake and tip out on table.
> Remove foil and roll up cake without the towel, and cover WITH towel if you are going to serve it that day; or put in plastic or saran wrap when cool. It freezes well.
> Slice in 1/2 to 3/4 inch slices. Serve with or without whipped cream or ice cream. Best served warm or at room temperature. Very rich and sweet. Serves 12 to 14 generously.
