> Boil 1 C raisins 5 minutes in enough water to have 1 C liquid to drain off to save. Cool.
> Blend together 1/2 C shortening, 1 C sugar and 2 eggs. Beat well. Add 1 tsoda and 1 t vanilla to raisin liquid, and add alternately with 2 C flour sifted with 3/4 t salt. Add raisins and 1/2 to 1 C chopped nuts. Bake in 17 x 11 inch greased pan at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. While still warm ice with thin icing made with powdered sugar butter and evaporated milk. Sprinkle with finely chopped nuts if desired. Cut into bars when cold.
