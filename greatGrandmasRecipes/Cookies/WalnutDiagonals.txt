# Walnut Diagonals
a:
* 3/4 C butter or margarine
* 1 t vanilla
* 1/4 t salt
* 1 C chopped nuts
* 1/2 C sugar
* 2 egg yolks
* 2 C sifted flour
* 1/2 C packed brown sugar
* 1/4 C dairy sour cream
* 1/8 t nutmeg

> Beat egg yolks into creamed butter and sugar. Add flour in thirds, blending well. Chill about 30 minutes. Meanwhile mix brown sugar, sour cream, nutmeg and nuts. Set aside.
> Divide chilled dough into halves. Roll one half into 15 x 6 in rectangle on lightly floured canvas. Cut lengthwise into 3- 2 inch strips, and place on an ungreased baking sheet.
> Fill a cookie press, fitted with a star plate, with remaining dough. Press out strips along sides and ends at edge onto dough strips. Spoon walnut mixture along center of strips.
> Bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
> Cut into diagonal slices.
> NOTE: Add 1 t vinegar to sweet cream to substitute for sour cream. If cookie press is not available, shape dough into strips about the diameter of a pencil; place along sides and ends of dough. With the back of a knife make a line down the center of each pencil- like roll, or press with a fork to make decorative edges.
