# Old Fashioned Cabbage Salad
a:
* 4 C shredded cabbage
* 2 T vinegar
* 2 T sugar
* 1/2 C salad dressing or mayonnaise
* 1/2 t prepared mustard
* 1/4 C whipped cream
* 1/2 t salt

> Mix together and chill until sewed. Serves 6. (Although this is the kind of salad my husband preferred, I never used a recipe, but added things to taste, so I have estimated the amounts in this recipe, and hope you like it). Drained pineapple may be added just before serving.
> A sharp knife will make thin, even shreds of cabbage. For a juicy slaw, use a fine shredder then chop if desired. A sharp knife does not bruise the cabbage, so juice is not pressed out so much.
