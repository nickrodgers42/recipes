# Tomato Scallop
a:
* 4 or 5 large onions
* 3 T butter
* 1 quart cooked tomatoes
* salt to taste
* 1/4 C sugar
* 4 drops Tabasco sauce(more or less)
* 1/4 t chili powder

> Peel and slice onions and saute in butter until lightly browned. Add tomatoes, salt, sugar, Tabasco, and chili powder. Cook until thick. Serve as a vegetable, or over buttered slices of bread. Especially good as a filling for Spanish omelette.
> Fred Sr. liked this very much, even with more Tabasco and chili powder. Lear Baugh used to say, That is just out of this world.
