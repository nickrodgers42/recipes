a:
* 1 lb medium sized mushrooms

Add chicken livers and saute until just barely firm, about 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in seasonings. Place half the liver mixture at a time in an electric blender, and blend until smooth. Cool. Beat cream cheese until fluffy; beat in liver mixture and parsley. Place in pastry bag with star tube. Pipe high into reserved mushroom caps, or spoon liver mixture into caps. Garnish with parsley, sesame seed or chopped nuts. Makes about 20 hors d'oeuvres.
