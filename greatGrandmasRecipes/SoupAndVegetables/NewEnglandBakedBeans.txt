# New England Baked Beans
a:
* 1 quart dry, white beans
* 1/4 t baking soda
* 3/4 to 1 lb pork fat
* 2 t salt
* 4 T molasses
* 1 t dry mustard

> Soak beans overnight in warm water. In the morning, bring to a boil in the same water and add soda. Boil 15 minutes. Put pork fat in bottom of bean pot or deep baking dish.
> Add beans, salt, molasses, dry mustard and enough water to cover. Bake all day in 350 to 400 degree oven. Add water as needed to keep beans covered. This makes one gallon of cooked beans. Refrigerated they keep a long time. Flavor is improved when reheated. Be sure to allow enough soaking water to allow for beans to swell.
> The Saints down in Maine traditionally served baked beans, cabbage slaw, and chocolate cake, to their families and friends every Saturday night, even if Christmas came on Saturday. Fred especially liked the beans. He brought this recipe home from his mission, and it has been our favorite ever since.
