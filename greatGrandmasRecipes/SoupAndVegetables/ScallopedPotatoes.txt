> In my growing up years on the farm, this was called Wash Day Dinner. With it was sewed rice pudding, bread pudding, custard or baked apples, all baked in the coal stove oven, because the top of the stove was utilized by the wash-boiler, and the making of starch etc., washday necessities. This special dinner somewhat compensated for the long hours of turning the washer, rinsing and wringing the clothes twice by hand and hanging them on the outside clothes lines.
