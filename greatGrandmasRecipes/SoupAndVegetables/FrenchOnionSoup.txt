# French Onion Soup
a:Richard Baugh
* 4 large yellow onions
* 2 T butter
* 1 T flour
* 6 C hot beef broth
* 6 slices French bread
* 3/4 C Gruyere or Mozzarella
* 3/4 C Swiss cheese
* 3/4 C Parmesan cheese

> Peel onions, slice thinly and separate into rings. Saute in hot butter until soft. Stir in flour. Add onions to hot broth. Cover and simmer about 20 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste. Ladle broth into individual oven-proof soup dishes. Place a round of bread in each bowl. Sprinkle with combined grated cheeses. Brown cheese under preheated broiler until cheese is bubbly. Serve immediately. Other cheese may be substituted. Broth can be made from beef bouillon cubes. At times, when I needed bed rest, this scup made by Richard, tasted Heavenly, and was a real spirit lifter.
