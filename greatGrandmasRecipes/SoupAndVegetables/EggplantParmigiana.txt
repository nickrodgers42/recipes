# Eggplant Parmigiana
a:
* 1 medium eggplant
* 3 eggs beaten with a little milk
* dried bread crumbs or cracker meal
* 1 C grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 lb sliced Swiss or Mozzarella cheese
* 6 oz tomato paste
* 1 clove garlic
* pinch of oregano
* salt and pepper

> Wash eggplant and slice without peeling about 3I4 inch thick. Dip slices first into flour, then into the egg beaten with a little miIk, then into the bread crumbs, so they are well coated. Saute them a little in vegetable oil, a few at a time, until they are nicely browned on both sides. Add more oil if needed.
> When they are crisp and brown arrange them in a low baking dish, and put a slice or two of the cheese on each one. Make a thick tomato sauce by diluting the tomato paste with a little tomato juice, or water. Mix in seasonings and the crushed garlic, and spread 2 or 3 T on each slice. Sprinkle the Parmesan on top and bake at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes. Serves 4 to 6.
