# Split Pea Soup
a:
* 2 C green or yellow split peas
* 3 quarts water
* 1 ham bone, diced ham, or bacon bits
* salt—pepper—season taste
* 1 large onion, sliced
* 1 to 2 C milk
* 1 C cream or evaporated milk

> Soaking peas overnight cuts down cooking time. if soaked, cook in soaking water, about an hour before adding ham bone. Continue to simmer with onion for 2 to 3 hours longer, or until peas are soft. Add water as necessary, but don't make it too thin. Remove ham bone and rub peas through sieve or put in blender. Trim ham from bone and add to pureed peas, or if no ham bone, add diced ham or bacon bits and simmer a little longer.
> Fried sausage balls make a delicious flavor. Now add 1 to 2 cups milk (according to how thin the soup is) and 1 C cream or evaporated milk. Season with salt, pepper and seasoned salt. Do not boil. Flavor is much improved the second day.
