# Marshmallow Treats On Picks
a:Judy Johnson

> Melt 1 small pkg Kraft caramels in double boiler with 1 can Eagle brand milk. When smooth, dip large marshmallows held by round toothpicks into mixture using spoon or knife to hurriedly cover. Then roll into Rice Krispies until coated. Cool on wax paper. Be sure caramel is kept warm over hot water while dipping. Makes about 36.
> I served these treats to the Relief Society Spiritual Living Class after using them as visual aids to emphasize the importance of being staunch in living the gospel, and not being soft centered like the marshmallow. I donâ€™t know how well it put over my point, but the members liked the treats. Judy Johnson had first served them to class leaders at Stake Preparation Meeting.
