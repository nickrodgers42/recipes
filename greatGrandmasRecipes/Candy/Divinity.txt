* 2 1/2 C sugar
* 1/2 C glucose (42 C plus 2 T corn syrup)
* 2/3 C water
* 1/2 t salt
* 1 t vanilla
* 1 C walnuts
* 2 egg whites

> Put sugar, water and glucose in kettle. Wash down sides and cook to 232 degrees. While it is cooking put egg whites into a warmed bowl. Beat until stiff but not dry. When the batch reaches 232 degrees add 1/3 of it to beaten egg whites. Pour very slowly and beat as you pour. Put the rest of the batch on the heat and cook to 248 degrees. Continue beating as the syrup cooks. Be sure the egg whites and the 1/3 of the syrup mixture is very stiff before adding the rest of the 248 degree syrup. Pour very slowly into the batch beating continuously, but not vigorously until the batch begins to set and pile up in the bowl. Then add nuts, vanilla and 2 oz of cocoa butter if desired. (Cocoa butter keeps candy from drying out). While it is still shiny and will hold its shape, drop by spoons full on waxed paper or pour out on a greased platter to be cut up later. Store in tightly covered container.
