# Loye Roberts' Candy
a:Loye Roberts
* 2 C sugar
* 1 C brown sugar
* 1 C rich milk (2/3 C condensed milk plus 1/3 C water)
* 1 T butter
* 1 t vanilla
* dash salt

> Mix all ingredients and cook to soft ball stage. Pour onto greased platter to cool. Beat until the right consistency to form into walnut sized balls. It will be like soft cookie dough.
> Chill and then dip in melted chocolate and roll in chopped nuts. Cooking time about 10 minutes after it starts to boil to get to soft ball stage. These keep well in a covered container.
> I make these nearly every Christmas.
