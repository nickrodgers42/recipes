# Quick Fudge
a:Ruth Baugh

> Cut up and mix 3/4 lb marshmallows, 3 1/4 lb Almond Hershey bars, and 1 C walnuts. Boil 4 1/2 C sugar and 1 large can condensed milk for 5 minutes. Pour hot mixture over the first mixture and stir quickly until smooth. Pour into greased pan. Cool and cut. Makes a large amount. Quick handling is necessary and the fewest strokes in stirring.
