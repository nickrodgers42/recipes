# Peanut Brittle
a:Phyllis Baugh
* 3 C sugar
* 1 C glucose or 1 1/4 C corn syrup
* 1 C water
* 1/4 cube butter
* 1/2 t salt
* 2 3/4 C raw spanish peanuts
* 1 t soda
* 1 t vanilla

> Measure and prepare all ingredients before starting to cook. If you use a slab, it should be warm. A cold slab hardens the brittle too quickly and it can't be stretched. Let hot water run over it. Dry thoroughly and brush with mineral oil or butter.
> Put sugar, water, and glucose into a 3 quart, straight side, heavy kettle. Stir until dissolved. Bring to a boil and wash the sides down with a small wet pastry brush, starting at the top, until no granulated sugar remains. Cover kettle for a minute after boiling begins will also steam the crystals off.
> Put a thermometer in the batch, and while it is cooking mix the salt, soda and vanilla in a small dish to be used at the end of the cook. Cook to 231 degrees and add the peanuts.
> Do not stir until it begins to boil again or it may start a grain. Stir to keep the peanuts from burning. Do not touch the sides of the kettle above the surface of the batch. Cook to 311 degrees. Add butter and move off the heat. Add salt and vanilla mixture, stirring well.
> Pour as thin as possible on greased slab. Quickly run a spatula or knife under the batch to let the air underneath. As soon as candy is hard enough to handle, (I use gloves to do
> this) turn the edge on the far side back a little. Take hold of the bottom part thus turned up and raise it to see if it will hold together. If it does turn the batch over. Stretch it in all directions. The thinner the brittle, the better it eats. Break into pieces when cold. Store in airâ€”tight container to keep it from getting sticky.
