# Luettaâ€™s Toffee
a:Luetta Baugh
* 1 C sugar (1 1/2 C sugar)
* 5 T water (7 T water)
* 1/2 lb butter (3/4 lb butter)
* 1 t vanilla (1 1/2 t vanilla)

> For 9x12 pan (For 10x14 pan) Cover bottom of dripper with coarsely broken nuts before starting to cook candy. Put sugar in heavy kettle and keep sugar moving until it feels warm. Then add water and butter. Stir and boil hard until mixture caramelize and real dark streaks show as it is stirred. It takes about 10 minutes. Add vanilla. Pour and spread over nuts. When a little cool put chocolate chips or semi-sweet chocolate over top, spreading as it melts. Put on as much as you like. Break in pieces when cold. Or while candy is still soft mark it into squares. It will break evenly when cold. Looks better that way.
