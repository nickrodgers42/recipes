# Date Nut Balls
a:Lucille Hansen

> In a heavy skillet melt 1 C butter, 1 1/2 C sugar, and cook until it looks creamy. (Just a few minutes) Add 2 C chopped dates and cook for a few more minutes. Add some of the hot mixture to 2 eggs beaten with 2 T milk. Then add all the cooked mixture and cook 3 minutes more. Take off heat and cool about 5 to 6 minutes. Add 4 C Rice Krispies, 1/2 C chopped nuts and 1 t vanilla. When cool enough to handle, dip hands in cold water. Form into balls and roll in coconut. It takes about 1/2 pkg coconut. Makes many.
