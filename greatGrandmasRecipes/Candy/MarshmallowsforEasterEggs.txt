# Marshmallows (for Easter Eggs)
a:
* 1 t vanilla
* 2 C sugar
* 3 pkg unflavored gelatin
* 1/8 t salt
* 1 C water

> Boil sugar, gelatin. salt and water until it foams full in the pan. Pour into a large mixing bowl and let stand 5 minutes. Add vanilla and beat at high speed until thick, yet still able to pour. It takes about 10 minutes or longer. Pour into molds. Let stand 15 to 30 minutes or until set enough to handle. Chill and dip in dipping chocolate. Makes about 10 large eggs.
> MOLDS: Molds are made of flour. Put about 1 inch of flour over bottom of dripping pan. With a real egg, make imprints in the flour about 1 inch apart. Carefully pour cooked mixture into these molds. When set, lift eggs from flour and shake off flour. Stick two of these haves together with icing. Dip into chocolate and decorate as desired.
