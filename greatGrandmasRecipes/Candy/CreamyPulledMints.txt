> Thoroughly blend sugar, water, butter and syrup. On low heat, stir until sugar is dissolved and mixture boils. Wash down sides of kettle. Put on lid and wash sides down. Boil without stirring to hard ball stage, 250 degrees. Remove from heat and pour on marble slab or pan. Add flavoring. Do not stir. When cool enough to handle, pull until light and fluffy. Stretch in long ropes then cut in pieces with scissors or sharp knife. Place on waxed paper until dry. Dust with powdered sugar. Pack in closed container in layers with powdered sugar between.
