# Popcorn Crisp
a:Luetta Baugh
* 1 C white sugar
* 1/2 C glucose or 2/3 C corn syrup
* 1 1/2 C raw peanuts (optional)
* 4 T butter (more is good)
* 1 1/2 C brown sugar
* 1 t vanilla
* 3/4 C water
* 1 t soda
* 1 t salt

> Measure all ingredients before beginning to cook. Mix and cook sugars, glucose, and water to soft ball stage or 240 degrees. Add raw peanuts if desired and cook to 290 degrees, stirring constantly. Add salt and cook to 300 degrees. Add butter and mix well before taking from heat. Add soda and vanilla. Stir well. Pour syrup over corn, coating it well. Pour onto flat surface to harden. For variation add 1 C small, salted peanuts or 1 C walnuts or 1 C shredded or flaked coconut to the popcorn before pouring on syrup. If roasted peanuts are used instead of raw peanuts, add at the time the salt is added or mix with corn before adding syrup. Use about 1 1/2 C un-popped corn. Makes much.
