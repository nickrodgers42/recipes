Knead 10-15 minutes until dough looks smooth and instered. Place in oiled bowl or crock and cover tightly. Let stand in a warm place until almost tripled in bulk and gives the ripe test. (Put floured finger into dough up to the first knuckle. If the dough is ripe it will leave a hole, and bubbles will form around the hole.) This will take about 1 hour and 50 minutes. Punch down and let it rise 40 minutes. Punch down again and let rise 20 minutes. Punch down again and let rise 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 loaves. Pat each leaf into a rectangle and pat out all the air bubbles you can. Fold over the short way and pat or knead it together again. Then fold ends to meet the center. keeping it in a rectangular shape. Roll from the sides pressing the rolled edges down firmly sealing the edges. Place formed loaf upside down in a well greased loaf pan greasing the top. Then turn the loaf right side up. Be certain the top of the loaf is nicely oiled. Let rise untiI double in bulk and bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Lower heat and bake at 350 for 25 minutes longer. Remove from oven and grease tops with butter or bacon drippings. Cool on rack.

> Never having seen a Yorkshire Pudding made, nor even tasted one, and with no recipe from my mother-in-law whose puddings were a delight to my husband, I have formulated this one from suggestions given me by Mae Taylor, and from descriptions and tips from my husband. He preferred a true custard-like Yorkshire Pudding without baking powder over the Americanized type using baking powder, which is more like bread. 
> To any meal with roast beef, the addition of Yorkshire Pudding made it a special occasion to Fred. If you have any English blood, you may like this.

# SOUR CREAM CANDIED NUTS
a: Leatha Lundahl

* 1 C white sugar 
* 1 C brown sugar
* 1/4 t salt 
* 1/2 C sour cream
* 1 1/2 t vanilla

> Sweet cream or condensed milk can be used by adding 1 t vinegar. If canned milk is used add a little butter. Cook, stirring constantly, to firm -soft ball stage. Store until creamy.

# PEANUT BRITTLE
a: Phyllis Baugh

* 3 C sugar 
* 1 C glucose or 1 1/4 C corn syrup
* 1 C water 
* 1/4 cube butter
* 1/2 t salt 
* 2 3/4 C raw spanish peanuts
* 1 t soda 
* 1 t vanilla

> Measure and prepare all ingredients before starting to cook. If you use a slab, it should be warm. A cold slab hardens the brittle too quickly and it can't be stretched. Let hot water run over it. Dry thoroughly and brush with mineral oil or butter. 
> Put sugar, water, and glucose into a 3 quart, straight side, heavy kettle. Stir until dissolved. Bring to a boil and wash the sides down with a small wet pastry brush, starting at the top, until no granulated sugar remains. Cover kettle for a minute after boiling begins will also steam the crystals off. 
> Put a thermometer in the batch, and while it is cooking mix the salt, soda and vanilla in a small dish to be used at the end of the cook. Cook to 231 degrees and add the peanuts.
> Do not stir until it begins to boil again or it may start a grain. Stir to keep the peanuts from burning. Do not touch the sides of the kettle above the surface of the batch. Cook to 311 degrees. Add butter and move off the heat. Add salt and vanilla mixture, stirring well.
> Pour as thin as possible on greased slab. Quickly run a spatula or knife under the batch to let the air underneath. As soon as candy is hard enough to handle, (I use gloves to do
> this) turn the edge on the far side back a little. Take hold of the bottom part thus turned up and raise it to see if it will hold together. If it does turn the batch over. Stretch it in all directions. The thinner the brittle, the better it eats. Break into pieces when cold. Store in air-tight container to keep it from getting sticky.


# POPCORN CRISP+

* 1/2 C glucose (42 C plus 2 T corn syrup)
* 2/3 C water 
* 1/2 t salt
* 1 t vanilla 
* 1 C walnuts
* 2 egg whites

> Put sugar, water and glucose in kettle. Wash down sides and cook to 232 degrees. While it is cooking put egg whites into a warmed bowl. Beat until stiff but not dry. When the batch reaches 232 degrees add 1/3 of it to beaten egg whites. Pour very slowly and beat as you pour. Put the rest of the batch on the heat and cook to 248 degrees. Continue beating as the syrup cooks. Be sure the egg whites and the 1/3 of the syrup mixture is very stiff before adding the rest of the 248 degree syrup. Pour very slowly into the batch beating continuously, but not vigorously until the batch begins to set and pile up in the bowl. Then add nuts, vanilla and 2 oz of cocoa butter if desired. (Cocoa butter keeps candy from drying out). While it is still shiny and will hold its shape, drop by spoons full on waxed paper or pour out on a greased platter to be cut up later. Store in tightly covered container.


# CARMEL APPLES ON A STICK

> Heat 1 lb (56) vanilla caramels and 2 T water over low heat until melted. Stir until smooth.
> Put sticks or wooden skewers into blossom ends of 6 crisp, medium apples. Dip each apple into caramel syrup and turn until surface is completely coated.

> Beat 1 C sugar and a dash of salt into 2 stiffly beaten egg whites. Fold in nuts. Melt 1/2 C butter in 15 x 10 inch pan. Spread mixture over butter. Bake at 325 degrees 30 minutes, stirring until nuts are coated and a little brown and butter is absorbed.


CANNING AND PRESERVING


# BRINE CURE

* For 100 pounds of meat:
* 6 gallons water 
* 12 lbs salt
* 3 lbs sugar 
* 3 oz saltpeter

> Dissolve the curing mixture in water and bring to a boil. This should be done on the day the hog is killed. Allow brine to get thoroughly cold. Never put warm brine on the meat. 
> Pack the meat in a clean oak barrel or stone crock. (We used to use the barrel until we found a crock large enough. Both were equally good, but the crock is easier to use).
> Rub a little salt on each piece as it is packed down. Let the meat stand 24 hours and then remove it and pour out the accumulated liquid. re-pack the meat, putting the hams in first, then the shoulder, then the bacon last. Pack all the pieces with the skin side down, except the last piece, which should be packed with the skin side up. Weigh the meat down so that it will not float, using a hard flinty rock for this purpose or a jar filled with water. Now pour the brine you made yesterday over the meat. Be sure all meat is covered. Keep the barrel in a cool, well ventilated place. After 7 days the meat should be re-packed to insure a uniform cure. If ropiness of the brine is noticed at any time, remove the meat, wash it, scald the barrel with BOILING water, boil and skim the brine, cool, and re-pack the meat. 
> The bacon should remain in the cure 1 1/2 days per pound, and the hams and shoulders, 3 days per pound.


# PORK SAUSAGE

* 5 lbs meat 
* 2 t pepper
* 5 1 salt 
* 2 t sage
* add other seasonings to taste

> All lean trimmings should be used for sausage. It should not contain more than 1/2 fat.
> Cut the meat into proper sized pieces to go through the mill; spread it on a flat surface, sprinkle seasonings over it, mix well and put through grinder again. (Grandpa, Frank Baugh, himself being an experienced butcher, liked adding 1 part lean beef to 3 parts pork sausage. Use like sausage).


# CORNING BEEF+

* For 100 lbs meat: 
* 6 gallons water 
* 12 lbs salt 
* 4 lbs sugar 
* 6 oz salt peter

> The brisket and plate are the cuts most commonly used for this purpose, although other pieces may be used. The meat is cut into 4 to 5 lb pieces. Pack the meat and apply the brine as for pork. The meat will be ready to use in about 10 days. Meat may be left in brine until used, but if left in much longer it will need to be parboiled.


# PICKLED PIG'S FEET

* 1/2 C vinegar 
* 1/4 C water
* 1/2 t salt 
* 1/4 t sugar
* 1 t mixed pickling spices.

* 6 onions, chopped (if desired)

> Cook ham with above ingredients, except salt, until done. Add salt to taste. Remove ham from bone and dice. Mix with beans and put in cans. Prosess and seal. 
> We did our canning at the Regional storehouse; ham, beans and seasonings were mixed together put in prepared cans and processed according to regulations. If canning at home, it would be necessary to consult the County Extension Office for the most up« to-date pressure canning procedures. It is not difficult after ingredients are prepared.


# CHILI FOR CANNING+

* 40 lbs chili beans cleaned and washed 
* 20 pints Heinz catsup
* 20 quarts tomato juice 
* 20 T or 1 1/2 C chili powder

# DILL PICKLE+
a: Ardella Baugh

> 1 cellophane bag of dill weed is enough for 4-6 quart bottles of pickles. Put 2 T sugar in each quart bottle. Add some garlic and dill as cucumbers are put in. Boil together: 5 C water, 3 C vinegar, 6 T salt (not iodized). Put 2 garlic buds, sliced in each quart bottle.
> Pour boiling liquid over cucumbers in bottles. Green coloring added to boiling liquid gives good color to cured pickles. Seal jars while hot. For sure sealing, place jars in cold pack canner and boil for 10 minutes. Store in cool dark place. Pickles are ready to use in about 3 weeks.


# PICKLED BEETS+
a: Mother Alice Baugh

* 3 C vinegar 
* 2 C water

> Stir as it thickens and cook a few minutes. Bottle while hot. Makes about 15 pints. 
> Fred's father used to grind the vegetables for this relish in the evening after dinner, counting the number of measures needed as he emptied the little pan into a large crock to settle over night. In the morning Mother Baugh would dip off some of the excess liquid, so the cooking time would be less, as the liquid had to boil away.
> I borrowed the little pan she measured with and found it held about 1 quart, then with Mother Baugh's guesses she came up with the recipe for chili sauce.


# CHILI SAUCE+
a: Mother Baugh

# ZUCCHINI RELISH
a: Cherrill Nielsen

* 5 C coarsely ground un-peeled zucchini.

> Store in cool, dark area.


# TOMATO SOUP

* 10 whole cloves 
* 7 bay leaves
* 14 quarts peeled, sliced tomatoes 
* 14 finely cut celery stalks
* 7 medium onions out fine 
* 10 sprigs parsley chopped
* 3/4 C sugar
* 1/4 C salt.

> Boil together all ingredients except sugar and salt for 30 minutes or until tender.
> Add sugar and salt then  thicken with 14 T flour mixed with water. Cook all together and seal while hot. Process at 15 lbs for 25 minutes. Makes 18 #2 cans or 10 quart jars. Add butter to soup when heating to use.


# SAUERKRAUT+

> Choose firm mature heads of cabbage and make certain it is clean. Cut into halves or quarters and remove the core. Cut the cabbage into thin shreds. Thoroughly mix 3 T of salt (not iodized) with 5 lbs shredded cabbage. Allow to stand and wilt slightly. This enables packing without breaking or bruising of the shreds. 
> Pack the salted cabbage firmly and evenly'into a large clean crock or jar. After each 5 lbs cabbage, use wooden masher and press down firmly until juice comes to the surface. Repeat the shredding, salting and packing until crock is filled within 3 or 4 inches of the top. Cover the cabbage with a thin white cloth and tuck the edges down against the inside of the container. Cover with a plate or a round waxed board that fits the inside of the container so that the cabbage is not exposed to the air. Put a weight on top of the cover so the brine comes to the cover, but not over it. A glass jar filled with water makes a good weight. Rinse cloth and board every few days, removing any scum that might develop. 
> A newer method of covering cabbage during fermentation consists of placing a plastic bag filled with water on top of the fermenting cabbage. The water-filled bag seals the surface from exposure to air, and prevents the growth of film yeast or molds. It also serves as a weight. For extra protection, the bag with the water in it can be placed inside another plastic bag. Any bag used should be of heavyweight, watertight plastic and intended for use with foods. The amount of water in the plastic bag can be adjusted to give just enough pressure to keep the fermenting cabbage covered with brine. 
> Formation of gas bubbles indicates fermentation is taking place. A room temperature of 68 to 72 degrees is best for fermenting cabbage. Fermentation is usually completed in 5 to 6 weeks. 
> TO STORE: Heat sauerkraut to simmering (185 to 210 degrees.) Do not boil. Pack hot sauerkraut into clean, hot jars and cover with hot juice to 1/2 inch of top of jar. Process in boiling water bath, 20 minutes for pints, and 25 minutes for quarts. (This for 5000 ft altitude.) Sea level is 15 minutes processing time. Add 1 minute for each 1000 feet additional altitude). Count processing time when water begins to boil. Remove jars and complete seals if necessary. Set jars upright, several inches apart to cool. Store in cool dark place. 
> Fred always added the salt when we made sauerkraut, sprinkling a handful over pressed down cabbage, not measured or weighed. His guess was excellent, always giving us well-cured, but not too salty kraut. The proportions given in the foregoing recipe are from the USU Extension Service. It is very good, but makes a little saltier kraut than Fred made. Because of the salt content in sauerkraut, it is advisable to use fresh pork with it. Those who have had much experience, say, long cooking sauerkraut with fresh bacon or pork shoulder pieces will insure finest flavor and texture. (Long cooking, like 3 to 4 hours). Reheating the second day is good. Many choose to heat wieners in the kraut the last 1/2 hour of cooking.


# SWEET PICKLES
a: Elizabeth Thorpe

> Wash 25 dill size cucumbers, or about the same bulk of small ones. Put in brine using about 1 1/2 C salt to 1 gallon water. Be sure salt is dissolved, and all cucumbers are covered with brine.

MEAT DISHES AND CASSEROLES

# PRIME RIB ROAST
a: Dorris Baugh

> (Made from pot roast)
> Choose a 3 lb chuck roast or larger, warm to room temperature. Wipe with oil. Do not season in any way. Set meat on rack in pan, and roast at 300 degrees for 1 hour (to kill bacteria). Then lower temperature to 175 degrees. The longer this cooks the more tender this cut of meat becomes.
> Roasting: Rare roast - 2 hours 15 minutes per lb. Medium roast - 3 hours per lb.
> Well done roast - 3 1/2 hours per lb.


# POT ROAST+

> Put 3 to 4 lb pot roast in large kettle. Add hot water to almost cover. 2 T vinegar may be added. Bring to a boil and dip off scum that forms on top of water. Add 1 large garlic bud cut in two, and a little salt. Cover and cook slowly about 2 hours, or until tender, turning the meat several times. When the water is boiled away, remove the garlic and allow the meat to brown, turning it several times, being careful not to let it burn. If the meat is not done, add a little water to keep it from burning and cook longer. 
> For a good variation in flavor, cook in less water adding: 2 chopped onions,1 T brown sugar, 1 T Worcestershire sauce, 1 8 oz can tomato sauce. 1/2 t dry mustard.


# TENDERLOIN OR RIB EYE BEEF ROAST+

> 7 to 10 lb beef roast, rolled and tied with string at 1% to 2 inch intervals. Rub with pressed garlic. Salt and pepper entire outside. Put fat side up on rack in roasting pan.
> Insert meat thermometer with tip in middle of thickest part, as near the center as possible, and not resting on fat. Set marker on thermometer at desired doneness. Bake at 325 degrees. Allow 20 minutes per pound for rare. (140 degrees), 25 minutes for medium, (150 to 160 degrees), and 30 minutes for well done. (170 degrees.)
> Allow meat to stand about 1/2 hour for best slicing, and remember meat continues to cook after it is removed from the oven, and can become more done than desired. Working and planning with Mahlon and Pearl Rice, Fred and l have served an annual dinner built around this kind of roast beef, to all the Baugh family since 1943, when we served 41 people. Now our guests total upwards of 100, and we cook 50 lbs of meat.
> Although our menu never varies, no one seems to want us to change from the traditional roast beef, mint sauce, mustard, new potatoes cooked with mint, and new peas cooked with mint and simmered in cream. Also, fresh spring vegetables, many from our own gardens, sliced cucumbers and red onions in seasoned vinegar, home made root beer, home made bread and butter, cakes and ice cream. There is always enough of everything for seconds and thirds.


# TENDERLOIN, T-BONE OR SIRLOIN STEAK+

> Cut steak 3/4 to 1 inch thick. Squeeze garlic bud through press, and put juice on both sides of meat. Salt and pepper the side that goes in the pan first. Fry fat trimmed off the steak before adding the steak, then add steak while pan is very hot. If juices make liquid in pan, the pan is not hot enough, and meat will not be tender. Allow to cook uncovered about 7 minutes; add salt and pepper and turn steak over. Cook about 5 minutes more until browned nicely. Transfer to hot serving plate. This steak will be rare. Allow 2 to 3 minutes more on each side for well done,


# ROUND STEAK IN MUSHROOM GRAVY+

> Cut round steak in sewing size pieces. Trim off fat and brown lightly on both sides. Place in casserole. Heat 1 can mushroom soup in the skillet that the meat was browned in. Add 3/4 to 1 can water and stir to loosen brownings from bottom of skillet. Pour over meat.

POULTRY AND EGG DISHES

# ROAST TURKEY

> IN OPEN PAN: Place turkey on rack in roasting pan breast side down. Do not cover pan or add water. Cover turkey loosely with foil, then press foil tightly at ends of drumsticks and neck; do not let foil touch top or sides of bird. Turn bird breast side up when about 2/3 done and lay a cloth moistened with melted butter over the breast; lay foil loosely over turkey. If thermometer is used, insert it now. Cut tie if drumsticks are tied and insert thermometer into thickest part of inside thigh muscle. Do not touch bone. Continue roasting. (See tests for doneness and roasting guide, below). 
> IN FOIL: This is a good way to cook large turkeys, 16 to 20 lbs.; smaller birds cook well this way too. The high temperature shortens cooking time. Season thawed, prepared turkey with salt, pepper, and accent in cavity before adding dressing. Shake dressing down, but do not pack. Close opening. Grease breast and legs. Place turkey breast side up in center of wide, heavy foil that's at least 12 longer than the bird; put two widths together with drug-store fold for big bird, and press to make a leakproof seal. Bring one end of foil up over the turkey; then bring up other end, lapping it over first end by 2 to 3 inches. Fold tightly. Fold foil down snugly over greased breast and legs. Press remaining sides up to hold drippings. Package will not be air tight. Place wrapped turkey in shallow pan, with or without rack. Roast in very hot oven (450 degrees.) Remove pan from oven 30 to 40 minutes before turkey should be done (see roasting guide). Open foil and fold away from turkey to edge of pan. Insert meat thermometer, if you use one. Return to oven until done, leave bird uncovered for the last 20 minutes to to brown. 
> TESTS FOR DONENESS: (1) Always make the pinch test; Protecting your thumb and forefinger with paper or cloth, pinch thickest part of drumstick. Turkey is done if meat feels soft. (2) Turkey should be done when thermometer reads 185 to 195 degrees.
> DO NOT FREEZE AN UNCOOKED STUFFED TURKEY OR A COOKED STUFFED TURKEY.
> These suggestions, taken from various good cooks, have proved successful for me. 
> The best turkey I ever ate was cooked to that perfection by accident, many years ago. Planning to use the slow method of roasting, and allowing 10 to 12 hours cooking time, I put the turkey in the oven at 11:00 pm, the night before Thanksgiving Day. About 4:30 am. I awakened to smell the delicious aroma of roast turkey, and hastened to check on it. To my surprise, I discovered the oven thermostat was not working and the oven heat was as high as it would go. Taking the turkey out, I was amazed to find it beautifully browned and cooked through. By this time, Fred got up to see what was going on, and as you might guess, couldn‘t resist cutting off a couple of slices, which the two of us enjoyed along with a helping of dressing. Fred called it a Thanksgiving dinner preview, and said it was the best turkey he had ever eaten. I agreed with him. Anyway, we were appropriately dressed for the occasion. 
> EDITORS NOTE: My favorite way to cook a turkey is using Reynolds Oven Bags. These are plastic bags big enough to hold a huge turkey, but can be tied small enough to hold a small turkey or chicken. Directions for preparing the bird, and the bags, are included in the package. The bag facilitates faster cooking and much easier clean up. Also, the turkey browns itself and the bag keeps the turkey from drying out during cooking. Liquid from the turkey is captured by the bag and can be used in the gravy. I recommend this method. Your favorite recipes for dressing and seasonings are not changed.

* 6 oz minced pork
* 4 oz water chestnuts, chopped 
* 2 green onions, chopped, including green part
* 2 T Nuoc Mam 
* 1 t pepper(white pepper is preferred)
* 1 egg lightly beaten 
* 12 to 14 sheets bahn trang(rice paper)
* Cornstarch(optional)

> Soak vennicelli, dried tree ears, and mushroom caps in water and soak until soft. Use separate bowls. Set aside rice papers. In a large mixing bowl add the remaining ingredients and blend . Adding a table spoon of oomstarch will give the mixture a smooth texture. To adjust seasoning, boil a small nugget of mixture and taste. Adjust seasoning if necessary. You only have to do this once if you write down the measurements in the ingredient list. In a bowl of warm water, carefully lower each sheet of rice paper and soak until soft. (Lynn likes to spray warm water on the rice paper while laying on a plate. This saves a lot of torn sheets. They are ve fragile.) Place a heaping tablespoon of the mixture in the center of the rice paper. Fo d over in half. Fold ends into center. Roll over once more and pat the ends down. Fry until light brown and crisp. For variation use 6 oz chopped shrimp or imitation crab in place of pork. Serve with fresh lettuce and mint leaves. Dip in Nuoc Charn.
> EDITORS NOTE: I copied this recipe out of the Food Section of The Salt Lake Tg‘pgge which Michelle sent to me and suggested I add it. She works with the author. I included it in the Seafood section because of the fish sauce in the recipe. The Sauce is called Nuoc Mam in Viet Nam, and Nam Pie in Thailand. It can be purchased in any Asian Market. The more expensive varieties are the best, and smell the least.

Add sugar and lime pieces and pound to a pulp. Remove to a small sauce bowl and add water, vinegar and fish sauce. Mix well and serve. Variations on the sauce can include chopped coriander, chopped ginger, pineapple and other fresh herbs.
