# Seven-minute Prune Whip
a:
* 4 egg whites
* 1/2 t grated lemon rind
* 4 t lemon juice
* 2/3 C sugar
* 2 jars prune baby food

> Combine egg whites, lemon rind and juice with sugar in a double boiler and while it heats, beat steadily with a rotary beater until the mixture fluffs up and holds its shape when you lift the beater out of the mixture. Fold in the prunes, cool and serve. This is good with cream or custard sauce.
