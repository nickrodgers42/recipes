# Caramel Custard
a:Emma Jean Maughan

> Caramelize 1/4 to 1/3 C sugar in top of double boiler. When melted, roll pan to cover with the caramel, as much of the pan to the level the custard will cover. Mix 3 beaten eggs, 1/2 C sugar, 1 1/2 C milk, 1 1/2 C canned milk, dash of salt, and 1/2 t vanilla. Pour into prepared double boiler. Bake slowly over hot water as for regular custard. Cool. Invert on serving tray, garnish with whipped cream, etc., as desired. Serves 4 to 5.
