> Chop suet very fine and dust with flour so it doesn't stick together. Add other ingredients and enough water to make a stiff dough. Sew in sacks or put in cans and steam 1% hours. Nuts, grated lemon peel, citron or candied fruits may be added. Serve hot with sauce and whipped cream.
> Add boiling water to mixed dry ingredients. Mix and add orangejuice and rind. Cook over boiling water for 1/2 hour or over direct heat 10 minutes, stirring constantly. (Sauce given for cherry nut pudding also is very good).
