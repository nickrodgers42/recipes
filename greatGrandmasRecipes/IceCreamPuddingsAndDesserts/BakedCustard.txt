# Baked Custard
a:

> Scald 4 C milk with 3/4 C sugar and 2 T butter. Pour slowly into 5 beaten eggs. Add 1/8 t salt, 1/2 t vanilla and 1/2 t Iemon extract. Pour into baking dish and sprinkle a little nutmeg on top (if desired). Set in a pan with enough hot water to come up half way on baking dish. Bake at 325 to 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean. Do not over bake. Serve plain or with cream or marshmallow sauce. Adding 1 C cooked rice before baking makes good rice custard. Good without butter.
