* 3/4 C sugar
* 1 C water
* 1/2 C top milk
* 1/2 C lemon juice
* 1/4 C sugar
* salt
* 2 egg whites, stiffly beaten

> Cook 3/4 C sugar, salt and water 5 minutes. Cool. Add milk and lemon juice. Freeze until firm. Gradually add 1/4 C sugar to egg whites beating until stiff and sugar is dissolved. Turn frozen mixture into chilled bowl; break into chunks; beat until smooth.
> Fold beaten egg whites into frozen mixture. Return quickly to cold tray and freeze until firm. Makes 6 servings. (Use less lemon juice for more milk flavor).
> DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING AND RIPENING ICE CREAM
> 1. Pour chilled mixture into freezing can, fill it 2/3 to 3/4 full to allow for expansion.
> 2. Put can into freezer; pack crushed ice, and rock salt around the can, using 8 to 10 parts ice to 1 part salt. Turn dasher slowly until ice forms a brine. Add more ice and salt in proper proportions to maintain ice level during freezing.
