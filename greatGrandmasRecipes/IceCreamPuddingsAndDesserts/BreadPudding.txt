# Bread Pudding
a:

> Prepare ingredients as for baked custard and put in baking dish. Butter, enough bread slices or pieces to cover entire surface of custard. Press bread into custard, so it becomes saturated. Sprinkle cinnamon on top. Bake at 325 degrees for about 40 to 45 minutes, or until custard is set. Serve with cream or milk and sugar. (This is a good way to use stale bread).
