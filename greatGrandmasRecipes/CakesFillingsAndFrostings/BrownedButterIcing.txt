# Browned Butter Icing
a:

> Heat 1/3 C butter until browned. Add 2 to 3 T cream or top milk, 1 t vanilla and enough powdered sugar to make enough thin icing to cover cake or cupcakes. Add more cream or sugar as needed. NOTE: For much of my life. we have had a cow to give us plenty of milk and cream, so the preceding recipes have been used often in our home.
> EDITORS NOTE: Topmilk, comes from the top of the bottle of raw milk after it has been sitting for a few hours. Half and half would be a good substitute. I would venture a guess that many in the younger generation have never seen or tasted topmilk.
