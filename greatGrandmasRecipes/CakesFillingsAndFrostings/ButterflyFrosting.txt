> Cream butter and gradually add part of sugar. Add remaining sugar alternately with the egg white, then the cream until it is the right consistency to spread. Beat well after each addition. Add vanilla and salt. This may be tinted or melted chocolate added. Add more cream if necessary. Good for cake decorating also. Does not become hard.
