a:Cherrill Nielsen
* 3 C sugar
* 2 C chopped nuts
* 1 1/2 C shortening, part butter
* 5 C flour
* 1 1/2 t salt
* 1 1/2 t allspice
* 3 eggs
* 3 t baking powder
* 1/2 C cocoa (or less)
* 3 C seedless raisins. steamed and drained
* 3 C applesauce
* 2 t cinnamon
* 1 t nutmeg
* 3 t baking soda
* 1 t ground cloves

> Mix butter and sugar. Add applesauce, sifted dry ingredients, and then the raisins and nuts. Turn into 3 well greased loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees for one hour, or until done.
> My original recipe from cooking class at Malad High School was for one loaf, and did not call for cocoa or baking powder but added 1/8 t cloves. Raisins were chopped and not cooked. Everything else was the same. I am surprised the two recipes are so alike, both very good. Included in my school recipe was a suggestion for a variation: omit the raisins in the mixture and bake in two layers. When cake is cool add raisin filling to bottom layer and place the other layer on top.
