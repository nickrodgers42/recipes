# Sweet Cream Cake
a:
* 2 eggs
* 1 2/4 t baking powder
* 1 C sugar
* 1/2 C chopped nuts
* 1 t vanilla
* 1/4 t salt
* 1 3/4 sifted cake flour
* 1 C whipping cream

> Beat eggs until very thick, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in sugar. Sift together dry ingredients and stir in alternately with cream. Add nuts. Fill greased muffin tins, or cups half full. Bake at 350 degrees 25 to 30 minutes. Makes 24 cup cakes. or 2 8 inch layers. I like to omit nuts in batter and sprinkle over top of batter when put in oblong pan.
> VARIATION: Add 2 t cinnamon, 1 t ground cloves, 1/4 t allspice, and 1/2 C chopped raisins to the batter and bake in paper cups. Always our favorite
