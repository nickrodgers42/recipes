# Favorite Fruit Cake
a:Lucinda Larsen
* 2 C grape juice
* 2 pkg(1 lb) seedless raisins
* 1 pkg (1 lb) seeded raisins
* 1 pkg(1 lb) currants
* 1 1/2 pkg(1 Lb) brown sugar
* 1 3/4 C butter or margarine
* 2 T vinegar
* 1 t baking soda
* 1 t salt
* 8 C flour (approximate) 8 eggs, beaten
* 1 teach cinnamon, allspice, cloves, ginger
* 2 T mixed fruit flavoring
* 1 lb chopped dates
* 1 lb candied fruit
* 1 lb broken nuts
* 1 lb tiny gum drops
* 1 pint maraschino cherries

> Boil the juice, raisins, currants, sugar, margarine, vinegar for 5 minutes in a large container: Cool thoroughly before adding the other ingredients.
> Sift together baking soda, salt, flour, eggs, spices, fruit flavoring and add carefully to cooled fruit. Do not mash. Batter should be firm, not sticky. Add more flour if necessary.
> Carefully add the dates, nuts, maraschino cherries, candied friut and gum drops and pour into well greased and floured pans. Level tops with a spatula and brush lightly with a mixture of molasses and cherry juice to make a pretty glazed effect when baked. Melted honey may also be used to glaze the top. Whole nuts and candied cherries may be placed on top for decoration.
> Bake at 300 degrees for 1 to 3 hours according to size of pans used. A pan of water may be placed on the lower rack during baking to keep the cakes moist. Test the cakes in the center with the tip of a finger to be sure of enough baking. The sides of the cakes will bake more quickly than the centers. When done the center will be as firm as the sides.
> Cool the cakes on wire racks and then wrap in aluminum foil and place in jars or cake savers for ageing. Fruit cakes are better after ageing.
> This was the recipe for the cake at Mary Alice and Clark Andersonâ€™s wedding reception
> EDITORS NOTE: I am not certain what size packages are called for in this recipe. I guessed 1 lb. This recipe makes a very large batch and will make many loaves.
