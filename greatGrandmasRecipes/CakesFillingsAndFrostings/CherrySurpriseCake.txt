> EDITORS NOTE: In the original book the directions were vague to the point that I didnâ€™t understand how this cake was made. I called Cherrill, who was given credit for this recipe and asked her about it. She claims that this was not her recipe and she has wondered about it since the book was published. Anyway, we think that we have the directions right, now. If we have missed giving credit for this recipe to the right person and you recognize it, I would appreciate it if you would tell me so we can give credit where credit is due.
