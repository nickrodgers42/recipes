> The first time I made this cake, Fred Jr., then about 9 months old, was in front of me sitting in his walker watching. Unexpectedly he took hold of the bowl and pulled it onto the floor. The bowl broke directly down the middle, dividing the dough and keeping it all in the broken halves. It frightened Fred and he cried. but I was so relieved to see the cake mix not spoiled, that I rejoiced. It turned out very good.
