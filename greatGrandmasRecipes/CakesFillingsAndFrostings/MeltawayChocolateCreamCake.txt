# Meltaway Chocolate Cream Cake
a:

> Sift together and set aside: 2 C sifted cake flour, 1/2 C cocoa, 1/2 t salt, 1 1/2 C sugar, and 1 T baking powder. Mix and set aside: 1/2 C milk, 2 t vanilla, 1/2 t red food coloring. Using a chilled bowl and beater, beat 1 C whipping cream, until cream stands in peaks when beater is slowly lifted. Using a clean beater, beat 3 egg whites until rounded peaks are formed.
> Gently but thoroughly, fold together the whipped cream and the beaten egg whites. Fold into this mixture alternately the dry ingredients in fourths, and the milk mixture in thirds.
> After each addition fold only until ingredients are blended. Do not over beat. Bake in two greased and paper-lined layer pans at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until tester comes out clean, or when cake springs back when touched lightly in center. Cool cake on rack 10 minutes. Cover cakes with cooling racks after loosening layers around sides with spatula, then invert pans, leaving cake on rack. Remove paper from cake and turn layers right side up. Cool before icing. This cake has very good flavor and fine texture.
