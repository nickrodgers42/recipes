# "that Good Cake"
a:Ida Harris

> Cut up 1 #2 1/2 can (3 1/2 C) of sliced peaches and place in an ungreased, 3 quart, oblong, Pyrex dish, juice included. Sprinkle a pkg of white cake mix over the fruit to cover. Cube 1/4 lb butter and sprinkle over the cake. Top with 1 C chopped nuts. Do not mix. Bake at 350 degrees about 70 minutes. Serve warm or cold with ice cream or whipped cream.
> Just plain cake is very good, too.
