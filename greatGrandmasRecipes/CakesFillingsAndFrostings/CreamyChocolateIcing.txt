# Creamy Chocolate Icing
a:

> Mix 3/4 C sugar and 3/4 C cream. Cook over low heat just until it boils. Pour slowly over 1 1/2 C shaved chocolate in a bowl (4 oz German Sweet Chocolate, or 3 oz (3 squares) of unsweetened chocolate). Beat until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. If too thick for spreading add a little more cream.
