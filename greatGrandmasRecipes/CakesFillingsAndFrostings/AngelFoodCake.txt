# Angel Food Cake
a:
* 1 1/2 C egg whites (12)
* 1 1/2 t cream of tarter
* 1/4 t salt
* 1 1/2 t vanilla
* 1/2 t almond extract

> Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees. Have egg whites at room temperature. Sift an ample amount of cake flour onto a square of paper or paper plate.
> STEP 1: Measure and sift together 3 times 1 C cake flour and 3/4 C +2 T sugar.
> STEP 2: Measure ingredients into a large mixing bowl  Beat on medium speed until foamy throughout. Add 3/4 C sugar gradually 2 T at a time. Beat about 10 seconds after each addition. Turn to highest speed. Continue beating until meringue is firm and holds stiff straight peaks. Scrape sides of bowl constantly with rubber scraper.
> STEP 3: Place fiour—sugar mixture in sifter and sift about 3 T over the entire surface of meringue. Fold gently by hand with rubber scraper or wire whip until flour—sugar mixture disappears, making sure to bring scraper or whip down through dent of batter and up at the side, turning the bowl a quarter turn with each stroke. This will insure thorough blending. This mixture will be very thick. PUSH the batter carefully with a rubber scraper into an ungreased 10 x 4 inch tube pan being careful not to stir it. CUT carefully through the batter going around the tube 5 or 6 times with a knife or steel spatula to break large air bubbles. Be sure to level up batter and be certain it touches sides of pan. BAKE 30 to 35 minutes at 375 degrees or until top springs back when lightly touched. Deep cracks in the top are typical of this cake. TURN PAN immediately upside down, placing tube part over neck of a funnel or bottle. Let cake hang in pan until cold.
> TO REMOVE CAKE: Loosen from sides and tube with rigid spatula or knife close against pan. Tum pan over and hit edge sharply on table to loosen.
