# Fudge Frosting
a:
* 2 C sugar
* 2 T cocoa
* 1 C cream
* 1 t butter
* 1 t vanilla

> Mix sugar and cocoa, add cream. Heat to soft ball stage. Pour onto greased slab or  platter. Place butter and vanilla on top. Cool. Whip by hand until fudge starts to turn light brown. If fudge starts to thicken quickly, thin down gradually with 2 T cream, to spreading consistency. Nuts may be added or sprinkled on after spreading. Very good on brownies.
