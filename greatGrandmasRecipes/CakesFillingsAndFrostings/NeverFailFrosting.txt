# Never Fail Frosting
a:
* 2 egg whites
* 1 C sugar
* 1/4 t salt
* 3 T water
* 1/2 t vanilla
* 2 t white corn syrup

> Combine all ingredients except vanilla in top of double boiler. Cook and beat as for 7 minute icing, but allow about only 3 minutes for it to reach the soft peak stage. When it reaches the desired stiffness, remove from heat, stir in vanilla and spread on cake.
> Enough for 2 8 or 9 inch layers.
> (This frosting keeps its nice texture longer than any 7 minute icing.)
