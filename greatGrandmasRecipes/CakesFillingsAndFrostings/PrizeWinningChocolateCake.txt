> When Richard was 13, he made a cake to be entered in a baking contest sponsored by the 6th Ward Relief Society. Lucinda Larsen was the Judge. These are her words: When judging the cake contest. I awarded the second place in the chocolate cake division to the maker of this very moist, fine-textured cake. It would have placed first if the frosting had been of a better quality. After judging all the entries by numbers and not names, I was happy to learn that this cake had been baked by a 13 year old Boy Scout, and that his mother had hurriedly made the frosting. This even really raised quite an ovation from the audience. This recipe was printed in her cookbook called, PARTY FOODS.
