> Mix all ingredients and let rise quite high. Pour out on well floured board(lots of flour). Roll dough and spread with softened butter. Fold dough 3 times. Spread nuts, raisins, cinnamon, and 1/2 C sugar on after the last fold. Roll up as a jelly roll and cut in 1/2 to 3/4 inch pieces. Placed in greased pans or muffin tins and let rise about 1 1/2 hours, or until double in bulk. Bake 7 to 10 minutes at 400 degrees. Ice with powdered sugar icing when cool.
> Leatha put a box of these rolls and some sliced cheese in our car the day of my father's funeral here in Logan. After the burial, which took place in Portage, Utah, and most of the day was gone, we drove home mighty hungry. Not having had anything to eat all day those rolls were very much appreciated. A pan of these rolls entered in our ward fair won 1st place honors.
