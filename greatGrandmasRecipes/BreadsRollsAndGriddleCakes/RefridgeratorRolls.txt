* 2 T warm water

> Combine hot water, sugar and shortening in a bowl big enough to allow for rising during storage. Cool to lukewarm and add yeast softened in warm water. Add egg and half the flour and beat well. Stir in more flour, enough to make a soft dough. Grease top of dough and store covered in refrigerator. It will keep 4 or 5 days. Cut off dough as needed. Shape and let rise in a warm place (80+ degrees) for about 1 1/2 hours. Bake at 425 degrees 12 to 15 minutes. Brush with oil or butter.
