* 2 pkg dry yeast
* 1/4 C sugar
* 1/4 C warm water
* 1 C warm water
* 1/2 C melted margarine
* 1 t salt
* 3 eggs, beaten
* 3 3/4 C flour (approximate)

> Soften yeast in 1/4 C warm water. Beat eggs and sugar together, add yeast and margarine. then the flour sifted with salt. Use only enough flour to make handling easy. Let rise until double in bulk in a warm place. Shape into rolls and let rise until doubled in bulk again. Bake at 425 degrees about 10 minutes. Dough may be refrigerated overnight and shaped and baked the next day.
> For speed, spread rolled out dough with soft butter, roll up like jelly roll and cut into 1 inch slices with scissors, placing out side down in greased muffin pans. These look very pretty and taste great. Makes 2 1/2 to 3 dozen rolls. 1/2 C whole wheat flour may be substituted for same amount of white flour.
