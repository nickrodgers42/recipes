# French Bread #2
a:
* 1/2 C warm water
* 2 C hot water
* 1 T salt
* 2 pkg dry yeast
* 6 C flour
* 3 T sugar
* 1/3 C shortening

> Dissolve yeast in warm water. Combine remaining ingredients, using only 3 C flour and beat until smooth. Add balance of flour to make a soft dough that can still be mixed with a spoon. Allow batter to rest 10 minutes. Stir batter down at 10 minute intervals, five times. Follow directions as in Recipe # 1. Brush tops of loaves with beaten egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Slash diagonally, let rise about 30 minutes, or until double in bulk. Bake at 400 degrees about 35 minutes. Makes two loaves. ( I like both recipes.)
