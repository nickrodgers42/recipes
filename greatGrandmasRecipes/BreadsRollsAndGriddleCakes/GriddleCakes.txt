# Griddle Cakes
a:Mary Alice Anderson
* 2 C sifted flour
* 2 eggs, well beaten
* 4 t baking soda
* 1/2 C melted shortening(bacon fat is very good)
* 1/2 t soda
* 1 3/4 C milk or buttermilk
* 3/4 T salt
* 1 T sugar

> Sift dry ingredients into bowl. Combine milk, egg, and shortening, add gradually to flour, mixing only enough to dampen flour. Batter will be lumpy, but do not over-mix. 1 1/4 C chopped nuts makes a nice variation. If all sweet milk is used, omit soda. Drop by spoons full on hot griddle. When cakes puff and bubble, turn once to brown the other side. Serve hot with maple syrup, fresh strawberry, or raspberry jam, butter and sugar, or blueberry sauce. Without the shortening it makes a good deep fry batter.
> BLUEBERRY SAUCE: Cook and stir 1 lb can blueberries and 2 t cornstarch until thick. Add 1 t lemon juice.
