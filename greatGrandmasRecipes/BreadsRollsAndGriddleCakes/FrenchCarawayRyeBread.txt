> EDITORS NOTE: While working night shift at Utapao Air Force Base in Thailand, I purchased some pastrami, some dijon mustard and a loaf of rye bread from the P X. I returned home thinking that I would have a pastrami on rye, sandwich for lunch. At home I took a shower and lay down for a nap. When I woke up. I went to make a sandwich and found a plate full of bread crumbs. Lynnâ€™s Mother had seen the bread and thought that the caraway seeds were insects and she had picked them all out.
