# My Usual Bread
a:
* 5 1/3 C miIk, scalded
* 14 C flour
* 1/3 C sugar
* 1/2 C warm water
* 1 T softened yeast
* 2 T salt
* 6 T shortening

> Add shortening to scalded milk and cool. It is not necessary to scald milk if it is homogenized. Set aside 1 C flour. Mix dry ingredients, add to milk and stir until smooth. Let stand 10 minutes covered. Turn dough out onto a floured, cloth covered board and carefully knead, adding flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking. Knead 10-15 minutes until dough looks smooth and instered. Place in oiled bowl or crock and cover tightly. Let stand in a warm place until almost tripled in bulk and gives the ripe test. (Put floured finger into dough up to the first knuckle. If the dough is ripe it will leave a hole, and bubbles will form around the hole.) This will take about 1 hour and 50 minutes. Punch down and let it rise 40 minutes. Punch down again and let rise 20 minutes. Punch down again and let rise 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 loaves. Pat each leaf into a rectangle and pat out all the air bubbles you can. Fold over the short way and pat or knead it together again. Then fold ends to meet the center. keeping it in a rectangular shape. Roll from the sides pressing the rolled edges down firmly sealing the edges. Place formed loaf upside down in a well greased loaf pan greasing the top. Then turn the loaf right side up. Be certain the top of the loaf is nicely oiled. Let rise untiI double in bulk and bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Lower heat and bake at 350 for 25 minutes longer. Remove from oven and grease tops with butter or bacon drippings. Cool on rack.
> For whole wheat bread, use same ingredients except use 10 C whole wheat flour and 4 C white flour. Let stand 1 1/2 hours. Punch down and let rise 30 minutes, punch down and let stand 20 minutes, Punch down and let stand 10 minutes. Donâ€™t let it get too light or it will be crumbly.
> With all the new bread mixers in use not, my methods of mixing are really outmoded. Anyway, you can say, That was the way it was done in the olden days.
> This recipe was demonstrated in Relief Society about 30 years ago. It originated in the extension office at Utah State University. I usually get good results with this recipe.
