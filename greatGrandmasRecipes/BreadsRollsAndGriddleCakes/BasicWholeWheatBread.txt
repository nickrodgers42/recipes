# Basic Whole Wheat Bread
a:
* 6 C milk (fresh, diluted canned, or powdered, or water or potato water)
* 2 pkg dry yeast
* 2 T salt
* 1/2 C sugar, honey or molasses
* 11 to 12 C unsifted whole wheat flour
* 1/2 C salad oil

> Mix together liquid, yeast, oil, sugar and salt. Add flour gradually and mix well. This dough should be more moist than ordinary bread dough. Cover tightly and refrigerate immediately. For best results leave overnight. If warm liquid is used dough can be worked after three hours. If left overnight use cool liquid so dough won’t rise too much.
> Remove from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature about 30 minutes. Turn out on greased or floured board and knead for 10 minutes. Divide into 3 or 4, according to pan size- Mold loaves following directions for white bread. Place in greased Ioaf pans, upside down first, then turning. Let rise in a warm place until almost double in bulk. Bake at 325 Degrees for 70 to 80 minutes. Butter tops of loaves and cool on rack.
> VARIATIONS: Raisin or nuts may be added to the dough of one of the loaves. Add 1 1/2 C raisins, or 1/2 lb chopped dates and 1/2 to 1 C chopped nuts plus 3 T sugar. Bake in 2 loaf pans or 2 46 oz juice cans.
> Add a cooked cereal such as cracked wheat or wheat germ which has been cooked in milk for 5 minutes to the dough. This produces a more moist bread.
> I like this whole wheat recipe. It was taken from a nice recipe book given to us by the Don Rigby’s, at a Christmas party for the Logan Stake Presidency and High Council. Along with the book they gave each couple 10 lbs of wheat. (The Rigby's have an enormous wheat farm in Idaho.)
