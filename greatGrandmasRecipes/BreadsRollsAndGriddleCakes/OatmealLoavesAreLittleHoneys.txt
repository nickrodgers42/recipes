# Oatmeal Loaves Are Little Honeys
a:
* 2 pkg dry yeast 1/3 C honey
* 1/2 C warm water
* 1 T salt
* 1 1/4 C milk, scalded
* 1 C rolled oats, uncooked
* 4 1/2 to 5 C sifted flour
* 2 T melted shortening

> Soften yeast in warm water,(lukewann for cake yeast). Pour scalded milk over honey, shortening and salt. Stir until shortening melts. Cool to lukewarm. Stir in 1 C flour and add softened yeast and oats. Stir in more flour to make a soft dough. Turn out on lightly floured board or canvas. Knead into a ball. Place in greased bowl, and brush lightly with shortening. Cover and let rise in warm place until double in size, or about 1 hour. Punch down, cover, and let rise again 10 minutes. Divide dough into 6 parts. Shape each part to form a small loaf. Place in greased 4 1/2 X 1 3/4 X 2 inch Ioaf tins. Brush with melted shortening. Cover and let rise until nearly double in size, about 30 minutes. Bake in preheated over at 350 degrees. EDITORâ€™S NOTE: As the baking time was left out of the recipe in the original book, you will have to watch the loaves closely to make certain they are baked through, and not burned.
> Both in home and in good restaurants, today. little loaves of bread are increasingly popular. They seem quite in keeping with the mini-vogue. I learned to make these long after the children left home.
