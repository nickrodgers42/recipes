# Butterflaker Rolls
a:
* 2 pkg dry yeast
* 1/3 C sugar
* 1/4 C warm water
* 1 C hot water
* 12 eggs
* 1 T salt
* 1 1/4 C evaporated milk
* 5 to 6 C flour

> Soften yeast in warm water; beat eggs, add sugar. salt and hot water, beating well after each addition. Add yeast, and up to 5 C flour, gradually. Turn onto floured board and knead until smooth and elastic, adding flour as necessary. Roll out to 1/2 inch thickness and spread with soft butter or margarine. Fold half dough over the other half, rolling lightly and spread with shortening. Fold again, spread with butter. After the 51 time, roll out to 3/4 inch thickness and cut with biscuit cutter and put into well greased muffin pans. Let rise 2-4 hours. Bake at 425 degrees for 8-10 minutes. Makes 32 large rolls. (I mix one square butter with 1/2 C vegetable shortening before spreading on the dough. Seems easier.)
> These rolls make entertaining simpler, as they can be made days before, put in plastic bags and stored in freezer until about 4 hours before they are to be baked. Your guests will think you are magic.
