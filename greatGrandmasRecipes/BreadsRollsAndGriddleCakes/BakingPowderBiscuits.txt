# Baking Powder Biscuits
a:
* 2 C flour
* 3/4 C milk
* 3 t baking powder
* 6 T shortening (bacon drippings are good.)
* 3/4 t salt

> Sift flour, measure. add baking powder and salt and sift into bowl. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender or two knives, until mixture looks like coarse oommeal. Add milk and stir until dough forms, about 20 strokes. Turn onto lightly floured board and knead. (20 kneading turns.)
> For high fluffy biscuits, pat or roll dough 1/2 inch thick and cut with floured cutter. For thinner, crustier biscuits, roll to 1/4 inch thick. Place on well greased baking sheet, turning biscuits over so tops are greased. Bake at 450 degrees 12 to 15 minutes. Makes 14 biscuits.
> None of our family seems to know exactly how our mother made baking powder biscuits, but we all knew she used thick separated cream for the shortening liquid, and made feather-light, tender biscuits. The best I can come up with, is the following recipe, altered to use 1 C whipping cream instead of the shortening and liquid. Handle lightly, and donâ€™t over knead.
