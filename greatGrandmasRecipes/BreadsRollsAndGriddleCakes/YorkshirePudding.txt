# Yorkshire Pudding
a:
* 1/2 C flour sifted with 1/2 t salt
* 3 eggs, beaten until thick
* 2 C milk

> Add 1/2 of the milk to the beaten eggs, then add dry ingredients. Beat until smooth. Add remaining milk and beat again. Put at least 1/2 C meat drippings in a 9 x 9 pan. Add Butter to make at Ieast1l8 inch deep in pan. Have pan very hot. Set it In heated oven while finishing the mixing. Be careful not to splash when pouring into the hot drippings. Bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes. then lower heat to 400 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes. When done the pudding should be light brown and crusty On top. More meat drippings or butter may be poured over the top before serving. Makes 9 servings. This is served with the main part of the meal, with gravy or with butter and sugar. Fred liked it with butter and sugar best.
> Never having seen a Yorkshire Pudding made, nor even tasted one, and with no recipe from my motherâ€”in-law whose puddings were a delight to my husband, I have formulated this one from suggestions given me by Mae Taylor, and from descriptions and tips from my husband. He preferred a true custard-like Yorkshire Pudding without baking powder over the Americanized type using baking powder, which is more like bread.
> To any meal with roast beef, the addition of Yorkshire Pudding made it a special occasion to Fred. If you have any English blood, you may like this.
