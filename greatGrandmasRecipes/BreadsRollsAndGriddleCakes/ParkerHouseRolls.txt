# Parker House Rolls
a:
* 2 C hot milk or water
* 1 t salt
* 3 T melted shortening
* 1 pkg dry yeast
* 2 T sugar
* 1/4 C warm water
* 4 to 5 C flour, divided

> Soften yeast in warm water. Using 3 C flour and the rest of the ingredients make soft sponge; let rise until light. Add enough flour to knead, 1 to 2 C, gradually. Keep dough soft. Knead, cover and let rise until double in bulk. Knead again lightly and roll out on a floured board until 1/2 inch thick. Cut in rounds. Put a bit of butter near center of biscuit, fold, and press the edges together. Place in oiled pan, oiling top of biscuit first, then turning over in pan. For crusty rolls, place 3/4 inch apart. Allow room for spreading. Place closer together for higher rolls. Place in warm place and let rise until doubled in bulk. Bake at 425 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes.
