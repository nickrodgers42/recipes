# Yorkshire Sausage
a:Richard Baugh
@

* 1 lb pork links
* 1 C flour
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 t salt
* 1 C milk

> Place the sausages in a 9 x 13 x 2 inch pan. Bake at 475 degrees for 15 minutes.  While sausages are baking, prepare the batter. Beat the eggs thoroughly until thick and lemon colored. Add the milk, flour and salt. Continue beating with a rotary beater for 2 minutes more. Remove the sausages from the oven. Pour off all but 1/8 inch of sausage fat. Arrange sausages evenly in the pan. Pour batter over sausages and return immediately to the over so pan wonâ€™t cool too much. Bake 10 minutes more. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue baking for 25 more minutes, or until golden brown. Serves 4. Very good with Dicks Hot Mustard Sauce.
