* 1 C salad oil, divided

> Blend egg yolks, 2 T vinegar, sugar, mustard, salt and pepper on medium speed for 5 seconds. On high speed, add remaining salad oil very slowly until thick and smooth. (If necessary, turn off blender occasionally and clean sides of bovvi with rubber scraper.)

> This recipe and the others made with a mayonnaise base were given by Winnifred Jardine, Food editor for the Deseret News. She says: Making mayonnaise isnâ€™t difficult. just requires a little patience. The oil must be added VERY slowly to the other ingredients to aIIow the egg yolks to absorb it. This gives the mayonnaise its thick consistency. Should the mayonnaise turn out thin or curdled, it is easy to correct. Beat 1 egg well; VERY slowly add to the thin or curdled mixture beating well after each addition.
