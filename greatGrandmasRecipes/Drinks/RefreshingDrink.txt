# Refreshing Drink
a:

> This good drink was served at a shower for Alicia Niederhausern Porrasâ€˜ wedding.
> Dissolve 4 C sugar in 6 C water. Cool. Add juice and pulp of 5 oranges and 2 lemons.
> Add 5 mashed bananas, and 1 46 oz can pineapplejuice. Freeze until slushy. Put in blender if desired to get the right smoothness. Add 7-Up or carbonated orange juice to make the right consistency. It should be thick like frappe. (My preference is the carbonated orange. It needs to be carbonated.) Frozen mixture can be kept in refrigerator a long time and used as needed.
