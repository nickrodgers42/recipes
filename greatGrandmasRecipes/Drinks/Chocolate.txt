# Chocolate
a:
* 4 quarts fresh milk (or reconstituted)
* 2 cans evaporated milk
* 10 squares unsweetened chocolate
* 1 1/2 C cold water
* 1/4 t salt
* 1 1/4 C sugar
* 2 t vanilla to taste

> Combine chocolate, sugar and water; cook over low heat until blended. Stir in evaporated milk and vanilla. Heat to serving temperature. Do not boil. Pour into hot milk.
> Keeping at low temperature for a few minutes improves the flavor. Allow 1/2 squares chocolate for each serving (approx). If syrup is made ahead of time, be sure it is heated again before pouring into hot milk (Serves 20 to 24).
