# Root Beer
a:Thelma Hunsaker
* 1 gallon warm water
* 1 1/2 t yeast (level)
* 2 1/2 T root beer extract
* 1 T vanilla
* 2 1/2 C sugar

> Dissolve yeast in 1/2 C warm water. Let stand about 5 minutes. Dissolve sugar in 2 quarts very warm water, then add cooler water to make it lukewarm, before adding other ingredients.
> Use gallon vinegar jar, not plastic. Fill jug within 1/2 inch of top. Close lid tightly; set in warm room 6 to 8 hours, then refrigerate. It is best the second day. There will be a scant quart more liquid than will go in the gallon jug. Do not leave more than 1/2 inch head space in container, or it will go flat.
