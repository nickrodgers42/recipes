# Tropical Punch
a:
* 1 can (46 oz) pineapple juice
* 2/3 C lemon juice
* 2 quarts cold water
* 1 quart pineapple sherbet
* 1 can (46 oz) pineapple grapefruit juice
* 1/4 C lemon-lime drink mix powder
* 1/2 to 2 C sugar
* 1 quart carbonated lemon-lime beverage, chilled

> Dissolve sugar and drink mix in the cold water; add juices and mix well. Pour over ice in punch bowl. When ready to serve partially mix in sherbet, and carefully add carbonated drink. Be sure some sherbet gets into each serving. Lemon or lime sherbet may be substituted, and the punch is very good without the carbonated drink. Makes 1/2 gallon.
> After our new house was built and we moved back into the 6th ward, we had an open house for ward members, family and friends. The date was January 2, 1977. Fred and I planned it, and our children did the work. Delicious refreshments were served. We hope our guests enjoyed it as much as we did. The following punch was served at the open house. I named it TROPICAL PUNCH.
