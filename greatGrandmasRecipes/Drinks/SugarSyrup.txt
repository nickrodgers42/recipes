# Sugar Syrup
a:

> Keep a jar of sugar syrup in your refrigerator during the fruit drink season. Use this instead of the dry sugar and water in making fruit drinks. A good proportion for the sugar syrup is one part water and two parts sugar. Use about 1/4 C for each quart of un-sweetened juice.
> You may want to substitute frozen concentrated orange or lemon juice in place of fresh juice. Two T of the concentrate will give about the content of one large orange or lemon.
