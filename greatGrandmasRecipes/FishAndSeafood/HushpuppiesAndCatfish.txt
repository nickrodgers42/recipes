> Place fish in shallow pan and pour on Louisiana Hot Sauce to coat well. Chill for 30+ minutes, turning once or twice. In a large bowl add flour, garlic powder, and corn meal; mix well. Dredge each piece of fish in flour mixture, pressing firmly. Be certain each piece is ooated completely. Return to refrigerator for 30+ minutes more. This helps the batter mixture to stick to the fish during frying.
> To the left-over batter mixture add onion, baking powder, egg, milk, salt and pepper, and some of the leftâ€”over fish marinade. Mix well. It should be thick.
> Heat oil to 375 degrees and fry fish until each piece is golden brown. Turn the fish once during cooking. After the fish are done, using 2 spoons, drop Hushpuppies carefully into oil. Use 1 spoon to scoop mixture and the other spoon to push mixture into oil. Fry till golden brown turning once. Serve.
