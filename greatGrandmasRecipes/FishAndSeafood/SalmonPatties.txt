# Salmon Patties
a:

> 16 oz canned salmon
> 1 T minced onion
> 1 egg white un-beaten
> 2/3 C evaporated milk
> 1 T lemon juice
> 1/3 finely chopped celery
> 3 T butter
> 1 C saltine cracker crumbs (about 18)
> Drain salmon, reserving liquid. Remove skin and bones and discard. Flake salmon in its liquid in a medium sized bowl. Mix with remaining ingredients; let stand 5 minutes to let crumbs absorb moisture. Divide into 8 equal portions and shape into patties.
> Melt butter in large skillet. Add patties and cook over low heat until golden brown, about 5 minutes on each side, turning just once. Serve with dill sauce.
