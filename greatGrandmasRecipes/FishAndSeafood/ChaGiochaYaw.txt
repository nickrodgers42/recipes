* 2 oz rice vermicelli, chopped
* 2 T dried tree ears,(wood fungus)
* 3 Chinese mushroom caps
* 6 oz minced pork
* 4 oz water chestnuts, chopped
* 2 green onions, chopped, including green part
* 2 T Nuoc Mam
* 1 t pepper(white pepper is preferred)
* 1 egg lightly beaten
* 12 to 14 sheets bahn trang(rice paper)
* Cornstarch(optional)

> Soak vennicelli, dried tree ears, and mushroom caps in water and soak until soft. Use separate bowls. Set aside rice papers. In a large mixing bowl add the remaining ingredients and blend . Adding a table spoon of oomstarch will give the mixture a smooth texture. To adjust seasoning, boil a small nugget of mixture and taste. Adjust seasoning if necessary. You only have to do this once if you write down the measurements in the ingredient list. In a bowl of warm water, carefully lower each sheet of rice paper and soak until soft. (Lynn likes to spray warm water on the rice paper while laying on a plate. This saves a lot of torn sheets. They are ve fragile.) Place a heaping tablespoon of the mixture in the center of the rice paper. Fo d over in half. Fold ends into center. Roll over once more and pat the ends down. Fry until light brown and crisp. For variation use 6 oz chopped shrimp or imitation crab in place of pork. Serve with fresh lettuce and mint leaves. Dip in Nuoc Charn.
> EDITORS NOTE: I copied this recipe out of the Food Section of The Salt Lake Tgâ€˜pgge which Michelle sent to me and suggested I add it. She works with the author. I included it in the Seafood section because of the fish sauce in the recipe. The Sauce is called Nuoc Mam in Viet Nam, and Nam Pie in Thailand. It can be purchased in any Asian Market. The more expensive varieties are the best, and smell the least.
