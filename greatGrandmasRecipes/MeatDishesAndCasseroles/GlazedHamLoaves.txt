# Glazed Ham Loaves
a:
* 1 lb ground ham
* 1 lb pork sausage
* 1/3 C cracker crumbs
* 1/2 T onion, chopped
* 1 T green pepper, chopped
* 1 T parsley, chopped
* 3/4 C apple juice or milk
* 1 beaten egg
* 1/2 t dry mustard
* 1 t brown sugar
* 2/3 C brown sugar (GLAZE)
* 2 t dry mustard(GLAZE)
* 1 t vinegar (GLAZE)
* 2 t water (GLAZE)

> Season with salt, pepper, thyme & nutmeg to taste. Mix well and form into 6 equal loaves, placing 3 stuffed olives in center of each. Place loaves on baking sheet, sprinkle each with a little flour and bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 35 minutes or until done and are firm on top.
> BOIL: 1 C brown sugar with 3 T vinegar and 1 T prepared mustard for 1 minute. Quickly pour some of this mixture over each loaf. Return to oven and bake until tops are glazed, basting with the syrup until all is all used.
> Mix glaze and spread over ham when about done. Return to oven for about 1/2 hour. If gravy is to be made from drippings, put glazed ham into another container for remaining oven period. Glaze makes drippings too sweet for gravy.
