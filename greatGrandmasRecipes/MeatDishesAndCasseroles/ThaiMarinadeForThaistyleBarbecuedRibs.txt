> Combine all ingredients and marinate in refrigerator turning occasionally. After at least 8 hours remove ribs from refrigerator and let stand for 1 hour. Arrange oven racks in the bottom and upper third of oven. Heat oven to 300 degrees.
> Fill a roasting pan 1/2 full of water and put on bottom rack of oven. Remove ribs from marinade and arrange on two racks in a shallow roasting pan. Place pan on upper oven rack and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, basting often, until meat is very tender. Do not baste for the last 20 minutes of cooking. Discard remaining marinade. Transfer ribs to cutting board, cover with foil and let stand 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into serving size pieces.
