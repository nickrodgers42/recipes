# Beef Ragu Brindisi
a:Tracey Baugh Wright
@

* 1 to 2 lbs beef chuck or stew meat
* 4 to 5 oz olive oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 liter tomato sauce
* 1 liter water
* 1 bay leaf
* 2 to 8 dried, hot red peppers
* 13 to 17 Roma tomatoes
* fresh Romano or parmesan Cheese
* penne or mostaccioli pasta

> Using a large pot, brown meat in hot olive oil until half cooked. Add chopped onion, bay leaf, dried red peppers, tomato sauce, water and tomatoes. Bring to boil and then reduce heat and simmer until meat is tender and tomatoes and onions have cooked down. This may take two to three hours depending on the temperature you are using.
> Remove bay leaf and hot peppers before serving unless you like a hot bite now and then.
> Include more peppers if you like spicier sauce, or just one or two for flavor. Prepare pasta according to directions making certain that you do not over-cook. Sprinkle with freshly shredded cheese and then top with Ragu.
> EDITORâ€™S NOTE: Tracey and her husband, Gerald Wright, were stationed in Southern Italy while doing a tour with the USAF. While there, her neighbor taught her how to make several Italian dishes and recipes. This is her all time favorite.
