# Italian Meatloaf
a:
* 2 lbs hamburger
* 1 C tomato sauce
* 1 medium onion
* 1 beaten egg
* 5 slices dry bread
* 1 t oregano
* 1 1/2 t salt
* 1 lb Mozzarella cheese, grated
* sliced ham

> Crumb the bread and mix with hamburger. Add egg, tomato sauce, salt and oregano and mix into meat mixture with your hands. Flatten the meat mixture onto a cookie sheet and spread with catsup or Italian meat sauce. Place 3 or 4 slices cf ham on half the meat and cover with grated cheese. With the help of a spatula fold half the meat mixture over the side with the ham and cheese and seal the edges. Lift the loaf onto the rack of a roasting pan and spread catsup or meat sauce over the top. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes. Serves 6 to 8. Preparing the meat on foil makes it easier.
