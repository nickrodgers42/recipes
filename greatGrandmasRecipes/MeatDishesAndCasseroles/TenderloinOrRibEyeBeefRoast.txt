# Tenderloin Or Rib Eye Beef Roast
a:

> 7 to 10 lb beef roast, rolled and tied with string at 1% to 2 inch intervals. Rub with pressed garlic. Salt and pepper entire outside. Put fat side up on rack in roasting pan.
> Insert meat thermometer with tip in middle of thickest part, as near the center as possible, and not resting on fat. Set marker on thermometer at desired doneness. Bake at 325 degrees. Allow 20 minutes per pound for rare. (140 degrees), 25 minutes for medium, (150 to 160 degrees), and 30 minutes for well done. (170 degrees.)
> Allow meat to stand about 1/2 hour for best slicing, and remember meat continues to cook after it is removed from the oven, and can become more done than desired. Working and planning with Mahlon and Pearl Rice, Fred and l have served an annual dinner built around this kind of roast beef, to all the Baugh family since 1943, when we served 41 people. Now our guests total upwards of 100, and we cook 50 lbs of meat.
> Although our menu never varies, no one seems to want us to change from the traditional roast beef, mint sauce, mustard, new potatoes cooked with mint, and new peas cooked with mint and simmered in cream. Also, fresh spring vegetables, many from our own gardens, sliced cucumbers and red onions in seasoned vinegar, home made root beer, home made bread and butter, cakes and ice cream. There is always enough of everything for seconds and thirds.
