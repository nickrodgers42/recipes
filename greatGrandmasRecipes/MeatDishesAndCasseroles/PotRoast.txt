# Pot Roast
a:

> Put 3 to 4 lb pot roast in large kettle. Add hot water to almost cover. 2 T vinegar may be added. Bring to a boil and dip off scum that forms on top of water. Add 1 large garlic bud cut in two, and a little salt. Cover and cook slowly about 2 hours, or until tender, turning the meat several times. When the water is boiled away, remove the garlic and allow the meat to brown, turning it several times, being careful not to let it burn. If the meat is not done, add a little water to keep it from burning and cook longer.
> For a good variation in flavor, cook in less water adding: 2 chopped onions,1 T brown sugar, 1 T Worcestershire sauce, 1 8 oz can tomato sauce. 1/2 t dry mustard.
