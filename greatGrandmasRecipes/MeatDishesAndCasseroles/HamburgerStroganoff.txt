# Hamburger Stroganoff
a:
* 1/2 C minced onion
* 1 clove garlic minced
* 2 T butter
* 1 lb ground beef
* 2 T flour
* 2 T minced parsley
* 1 T salt-pepper
* 1 can cream of chicken soup
* 4 8 oz cans mushrooms undrained
* 1 C sour cream (use canned milk and 2 T vinegar)

> Fry onion and garlic in butter; add meat and brown. Add salt, pepper, flour, mushrooms and cook 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream, heat thoroughly, but do not boil. Serve immediately. Serve over parsley noodles. Serves 4 to 6. For variety, fry 3 slices bacon with the hamburger.
> This was the main dish I served at our 51h South neighborhood party, many years ago. It rained until nearly time for the guests to arrive, then the sun came out and everything was warm. The lawns were still wet, so we mopped the driveway dry, and set up tables there. The party was a big success.
