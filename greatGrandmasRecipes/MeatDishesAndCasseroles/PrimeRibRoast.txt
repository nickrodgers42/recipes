> (Made from pot roast)
> Choose a 3 lb chuck roast or larger, warm to room temperature. Wipe with oil. Do not season in any way. Set meat on rack in pan, and roast at 300 degrees for 1 hour (to kill bacteria). Then lower temperature to 175 degrees. The longer this cooks the more tender this cut of meat becomes.
> Roasting: Rare roast - 2 hours 15 minutes per lb. Medium roast - 3 hours per lb.
> Well done roast - 3 1/2 hours per lb.
