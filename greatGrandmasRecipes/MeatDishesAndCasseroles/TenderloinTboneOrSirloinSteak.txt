# Tenderloin, T-bone Or Sirloin Steak
a:

> Cut steak 3/4 to 1 inch thick. Squeeze garlic bud through press, and put juice on both sides of meat. Salt and pepper the side that goes in the pan first. Fry fat trimmed off the steak before adding the steak, then add steak while pan is very hot. If juices make liquid in pan, the pan is not hot enough, and meat will not be tender. Allow to cook uncovered about 7 minutes; add salt and pepper and turn steak over. Cook about 5 minutes more until browned nicely. Transfer to hot serving plate. This steak will be rare. Allow 2 to 3 minutes more on each side for well done,
