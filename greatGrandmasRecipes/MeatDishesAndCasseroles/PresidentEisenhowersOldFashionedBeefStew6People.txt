a:
* 2 lbs stewing meat
* 1 lb potatoes
* 2 1/2 pints beef stock
* 1 1/4 lbs carrots
* 3/4 lb small onions
* 1 C tomatoes
* Salt, pepper
* 2 bay leaves
* 1/2 t thyme
* 1/2 t Accent (MSG)
* 1 clove garlic

> Stew meat until tender. Add vegetables and seasonings. When vegetables are done, strain off stock, and thicken slightly with beef roux. Pour back into stew and simmer 1/2 hour longer. Beef bones cooked with meat enhance flavor of stock. thicken it with 6 T flour.
> Soon after President Eisenhower occupied the White House, he offered his favorite stew recipe to anyone who would write for it. The following recipes came in answer to my stew request. We have liked them very much. We even put this in cans.
