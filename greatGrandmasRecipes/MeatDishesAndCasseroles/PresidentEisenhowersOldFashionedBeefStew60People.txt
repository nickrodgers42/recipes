# President Eisenhower's Old Fashioned Beef Stew (60 People)
a:
* 20 lbs stew meat
* 15 fresh tomatoes or 3 quarts canned
* 8 lbs small Irish potatoes(we used red)
* 12 1/2 lbs small carrots
* 5 lbs small onions
* 3 gallons beef stock
* 1 bunch bouquet garniture (thyme, garlic bay leaves, etc. in cloth bag).
* salt, pepper, accent(MSG)

> Stew meat until tender. Add vegetables and seasonings. When vegetables are done, strain off 2 gallons stock, and thicken slightly with beef roux. Pour back into stew and simmer 1/2 hour longer. Beef bones cooked with meat enhance flavor of stock.
> Soon after President Eisenhower occupied the White House, he offered his favorite stew recipe to anyone who would write for it. The following recipes came in answer to my stew request. We have liked them very much. We even put this in cans.
