# Moo (pork) Satay

@

* 2 lbs very lean pork loin
* 3 T curry powder
* 1/2 t ground, hot chilies
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 large onions, minced
* 4 T lime juice
* 1 T honey

> Slice the meat into thin strips, no more than 1/4 inch thick and about 1 inch wide. Make strips paperâ€”thin if possible. Mix curry powder, chilies, garlic onions, salt, lime juice and honey in a large bowl. Add the meat strips and toss well to cover with marinade.
> Marinate for at least two hours. Thread meat strips on bamboo skewers, enough to cover entire skewer. Make sure that plenty of onion and garlic bits cling to the meat.
> Arrange skewers of meat in a dish, cover with remaining marinade and refrigerate while making the sauce. Brown or grill the meat skewers and serve with the warmed peanut butter sauce (page 145) for dipping.
