# Baked Pork Chops
a:
* 6 thick center cut pork chops
* 2 cans condensed mushroom soup

> Trim fat from chops and brown quickly in frying pan. Put in shallow baking dish and pour the undiluted soup over them. Bake at 325 degrees for 45 minutes or until tender. Add more soup if necessary, or a little water to keep chops from getting dry. Soup makes delicious gravy. Very good with baked potatoes. Serves 6.
